<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>This volume is designed as a companion and sequel
to my former volume called "Architectural and Historical
Sketches, chiefly Italian." Its general plan is
the same. But more of the papers in the present
volume appear for the first time than was the case with
the earlier one, and most of those which are reprinted
have been more largely changed in reprinting than
those which appeared in the former book. This could
hardly be otherwise with the pieces relating to the
lands east of the Hadriatic, where I have had to work
in remarks made during later journeys, and where
great events have happened since I first saw those
lands.</p>

<p>The papers are chiefly the results of three journeys.
The first, in the autumn of 1875, took in Dalmatia
and Istria, with Trieste and Aquileia. At that time
the revolt of Herzegovina had just begun, and Ragusa
was crowded with refugees. Some of the papers
contained references to the state of things at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI">vi</a></span>
moment, and those references I saw no reason to alter.
But I may as well say that the time of my first visit
to the South-Slavonic lands was not chosen with reference
to any political or military object. The journey
was planned before the revolt began; it was in fact
the accomplishment of a thirty years' yearning after
the architectural wonders of Spalato, which till that
year I had been unable to gratify. If that visit
taught me some things with regard to our own times
as well as to earlier times, it is not, I think, either
wonderful or blameworthy.</p>

<p>In 1877 I visited Dalmatia for the second time, and
Greece for the first. I should be well pleased some
day to put together some out of many papers on the
more distant Greek lands. In this volume I have
brought in those on Corfu only, as that island forms
an essential part of my present subject.</p>

<p>In the present year 1881 I again visited Dalmatia
and some parts of Istria and Albania, as also a large
part of Italy. This has enabled me to add some
papers on the Venetian possessions both in northern
and southern Italy, as also one on the Dalmatian
island of Curzola, which on former visits I had seen
only in passing.</p>

<p>The papers headed "Treviso," "Gorizia," "Spalato
revisited," "Trani," "Otranto," "Corfu to Durazzo,"
and "Antivari," are all due to this last journey, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">vii</a></span>
have never been in print before. That on "Curzola"
appeared in <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i> for September 1881.
Those headed "Udine and Cividale," "Aquileia,"
"Trieste to Spalato," "Spalato to Cattaro," "A trudge
to Trebinje," appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> in
1875. The rest appeared in the <i>Saturday Review</i> in
1875 and 1876. But many of them have been so
much altered that they can hardly be called mere
reprints; they are rather recastings, with large additions,
omissions, and changes, such as the light of
second and third visits seemed to call for.</p>

<p>I made none of these journeys alone, and I have
much for which to thank the companions with whom
I made them. In 1877 I was with the Earl of Morley
and Mr. J. F. F. Horner. And I must not forget to
mention that it was Lord Morley who at once read
and explained the inscription in the basilica of Parenzo,
when Mr. Horner and I had seen that Mr. Neale's
explanation was nonsense, but had not yet hit upon
anything better for ourselves. In a great part of my
two later journeys I had the companionship of Mr.
Arthur Evans, my friend of 1877, my son-in-law of
1881. How much I owe to his knowledge of South-Slavonic
matters, words would fail me to tell. I had
seen Dalmatia for the first time, and I had begun to
write about it, before I knew him and, I believe,
before he had published anything; otherwise I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">viii</a></span>
almost feel myself an intruder in a province which he
has made his own. One out of many points I may
specially mention. It was Mr. Evans who found and
explained the two missing capitals from the palace at
Ragusa, which are at once so remarkable in themselves
and which throw so much light on the history
of the building.</p>

<p>The illustrations to my former volume met with
some severe criticism. But I am bound to say that of
that severe criticism I agreed to every word. Only
I thought that the critics would perhaps have been
less severe if they had seen my original drawings
themselves. The illustrations to the present volume
have been made by a new process, partly, as before,
from my own sketches, but partly also from photographs.
I trust that they will be found less unsatisfactory
than those that went before them.</p>

<p>As there are in these papers a good many historical
references, some of them to rather out-of-the-way
matters, but matters which could not always be explained
at length in the text, I have drawn up a
chronological table of the chief events in the history
of the lands and cities of which I have had to speak.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that this volume, though I hope it
may be useful to travellers on the spot, is not strictly
a guide-book. But a good guide-book to Istria and
Dalmatia is much needed. I am not joking when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">ix</a></span>
say that the best guide to those parts is still the
account written by the Emperor Constantino Porphyrogenitus
more than nine hundred years back. But it
is surely high time that there should be another. The
attempts made in one or two of Murray's Handbooks
are very poor. Sir Gardner Wilkinson's "Dalmatia
and Montenegro," published more than thirty years
ago, is an admirable book, and one to which I owe a
very deep debt of gratitude. It first taught me what
there was to see in the East-Hadriatic lands. But it
is over-big for a guide-book. Mr. Neale's book
contains some information, and, even in its ecclesiastical
grotesqueness, it is sometimes instructive as
well as amusing. But we can hardly take as our
guide one who leaves out the Ragusan palace and
who, when at Spalato, does not think of Diocletian.
It would be in itself well if Gsel-fels, the prince of
guide-book-makers, would do for Dalmatia as he has
done for Sicily; but one would rather see it done in
our own tongue.</p>

<h2>THE LOMBARD AUSTRIA.</h2>

<h3>TREVISO.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>
<h4>1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The north-eastern corner of Italy is one of those parts
of the world which have gone through the most remarkable
changes. That it has often changed its
political masters is only common to it with the rest
of Italy, and with many other lands as well. The
physical changes too which the soil and its waters
have gone through are remarkable, but they are not
unparalleled. The Po may perhaps be reckoned as
the frontier stream of the region towards the south,
and the many paths by which the Po has found its
way into the Hadriatic need not be dwelled on. We
are more concerned with rivers further to the north-east.
The Isonzo no longer represents the course of
the ancient Sontius; the Natisone no longer flows by
fallen Aquileia. The changes of the coast-line which
have made what is left of Aquileia inland have their
counterparts at Pisa and at Ravenna. In the range
of historical geography, the most curious feature is
the way in which certain political names have kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
on an abiding life in this region, though with singular
changes of meaning. The land has constantly been
either Venetian or Austrian; sometimes it has been
Venetian and Austrian at once. But it has been
Venetian and Austrian in various meanings. It was
Venetian long before the name of Venice was heard
of in its present sense; it was Austrian long before
the name of Austria was heard of in its present
sense. The land of the old Veneti bore the Venetian
name ages before the city of Venice was in being,
and it keeps it now that Venice has ceased to be a
political power. Venetian then the land has ever
been in one sense, while a large part of it was for
some centuries Venetian in another sense, in the days
when so many of its cities bowed to Saint Mark and
his commonwealth as its rulers. Austrian the land
was in the old geographical sense, when it formed
the Lombard <i>Austria</i>&mdash;the eastern half, the <i>Eastrice</i>&mdash;that
form would, we suspect, come nearer to Lombard
speech than <i>Oesterreich</i>&mdash;of the Lombard realm.
But if the Lombard realm had its Austria and its
Neustria, so also had the Frankish realm. Wherever
a land could be easily divided into east and west,
there was an <i>Austria</i>, and its negative a <i>Neustria</i>.
Lombardy then had its Austria, and its <i>Austria</i> was
found in the old and the new Venetian land. No
one perhaps ever spoke of the Karlings as the House
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
of Austria, or of their Empire as the dominions of
the House of Austria. And yet the name would not
have been out of place. Their dominion marked the
predominance of the eastern part of the Frankish
realm&mdash;its <i>Oesterreich</i>, its <i>Austrasia</i>, its <i>Austria</i>&mdash;over
the Neustrian power of the earlier dynasty. The
Lombard Austria became part of the dominions of
those who were before all things lords of the Frankish
Austria. And in later times, when the Lombard
and the Frankish Austria were both forgotten, when
the name clave only to a third Austria, the more
modern Austria of Germany&mdash;the Eastern mark called
into being to guard Germany from the Magyar&mdash;the
Venetian land has more than once become Austrian
in another sense; some of it in that sense remains
Austrian still. Dukes of the most modern Austria&mdash;plain
dukes who were satisfied with being dukes&mdash;archdukes
who were Emperors by lawful election&mdash;archdukes
who have had a strange fancy for calling
themselves Emperors of their archduchy&mdash;have all
of them at various times borne rule over the whole
or part of the older Austria of Lombardy. To-day
the north-eastern corner of Italy, land of Venetia,
the once Lombard Austria, is parted asunder by an
artificial boundary between the dominions of the
Italian King and the lord of the later Austria. And,
what a passing traveller might not easily find out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
in this old Venetian land, in both parts of it, alike
under modern Italian and under modern Austrian
rule, besides the Latin speech which everywhere meets
the eye and the ear, the speech of Slavonic settlers
still lingers. Settlers they are in the Venetian land,
no less than its Roman or its German masters. It is
hard to say who the old Veneti were, perhaps nearer
akin to the Albanians than to any other European
people. At all events there is no reason for thinking
that they were Slaves. The presence of a Slavonic
speech in this region is a fruit of the same migration
which made the land beyond Hadria Slavonic. But
to hear the Slavonic and the Italian tongues side
by side is so familiar a phænomenon under modern
Austrian rule, that its appearance at Aquileia or Gorizia
may with some minds seem to give the land a specially
Austrian character, and may help to shut out the remembrance
that at Aquileia and Gorizia we are within
the ancient kingdom of Italy. Nay it may be a
new and strange thing to many to hear that, even
within the bounds of the modern kingdom of Italy,
there are districts where, though Italian is the cultivated
tongue, yet Slave is the common peasant
speech.</p>

<p>But besides physical changes, changes of name,
changes of inhabitants, we are perhaps yet more deeply
struck with the fluctuations in the history of the cities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
of this region. In this matter, throughout the Venetian
land, the first do indeed become last and the last first.
No city in this region has kept on that enduring life
through all changes which has belonged to many cities
in other parts of Europe. We do not here find the
Roman walls, or the walls yet earlier than Roman
days, fencing in dwelling-places of man which have
been continuously inhabited, which have sometimes
been continuously flourishing, through all times of
which history has anything to tell us. We need not
take our examples from Rome or Athens or Argos or
the Ph&oelig;nician Gades. It is enough to look to one or
two of the capitals of modern Europe. At the beginning
of the fifth century, London and Paris, not yet
indeed capitals of kingdoms, were already in being,
and had been in being for some centuries. But far
above either ranked the great city of north-eastern
Italy, then one of the foremost cities of the world,
the ancient colony of Aquileia, keeper of one of the
great lines of approach towards Italy and Rome. No
one city had then taken the name of the Venetian
land; no wanderers from the mainland had as yet
settled down like sea-fowl, as Cassiodorus puts it, on
the islands of the lagoons. By the end of the fifth
century both London and Paris had passed from
Roman rule to the rule of Teutonic conquerors.
London, we may conceive, was still inhabited; at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
events its walls stood ready to receive a fresh colony
before long. Paris had received one of those momentary
lifts of which she went through several
before her final exaltation; the city which had been
favoured by Roman Julian was favoured also by
Frankish Chlodwig. But Aquileia had felt the full
fury of invaders who came, not to occupy or to settle,
but simply to destroy. As a city, as a bulwark of
Italy, she had passed away for ever. But out of her
fall several cities had, in the course of that century,
risen to increased greatness, and the greatest of all
had come into being. The city was born which,
simply as a city, as a city bearing rule over distant
lands, must rank as the one historic peer of Rome.
Not yet Queen of the Hadriatic, not yet the chosen
sanctuary of Saint Mark, not yet enthroned on her
own Rialto, the settlement which was to grow into
Venice had already made its small beginnings.</p>

<p>But the fall of Aquileia, the rise of Venice, are
only the greatest examples of a general law. A
nearer neighbour of Aquileia at once profited by her
overthrow; Grado, on her own coast, almost at her
own gates, sprang up as her rival; but the greatness
of Grado has passed away only less thoroughly than
the greatness of Aquileia. So the Venetian Forum
Julii gave way to its more modern neighbour Udine.
It lost the name which it had given to the land around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
it. Its shortened form <i>Friuli</i> lived on as one of the
names of the surrounding district, but Forum Julii
itself was forgotten under the vaguer description of
<i>Cividale</i>. Gorizia has been for ages the head of a
principality; in later times it has been the head of
an ecclesiastical province. But Gorizia is absolutely
unknown till the beginning of the eleventh century,
and it does not seem even to have supplanted any
earlier city. It is thus a marked peculiarity of this
district that the chief towns, with Venice itself at
their head, have not lived on continuously as chief
towns from Roman or earlier times. West of Venice
the rule does not apply. Padua and Verona are old
enough for the warmest lover of antiquity, and
Vicenza, going back at least to the second century
<span class="s05">B.C.</span>, must be allowed to be of a respectable age.</p>

<p>That the chief cities of a district should date from
early mediæval, and not from Roman times, is a feature
which at once suggests analogies with our own island.
Both in Venetia and in Britain we are struck with the
prevalence of places which arose after the fall of the
elder Roman power, in opposition to most parts of
Italy and Gaul, where nearly every town can trace
back to Roman days or earlier. But the likeness
cannot be carried out in detail. In the district which
we have just marked out it is absolutely the greatest
cities&mdash;one of them so great as to be put out of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
comparison with the others&mdash;which are of this comparatively
recent date. In England, though the great
mass of the local centres are places of English foundation
and bearing English names, yet the greatest and
most historic cities still carry the marks of Roman origin
about them. Some Roman cities in Britain passed
utterly away; others lived on, or soon came to life
again, in the forms of York, London, and Winchester.
But in Venetia it is the cities which answer to York
and London which have lost their greatness, though
they have not utterly passed away. This last fact
is one of the characteristics of the district; the
fallen cities have simply fallen from their greatness;
they have not ceased to be dwelling-places of man.
Aquileia and Forum Julii have ceased for ages to be
what Aquileia and Forum Julii once were, but they
have not become as Silchester, or even as Salona. Of
the position of all these places there is no manner of
doubt. They are there to speak for themselves; even
Julium Carnacum, whose site has had to be looked for,
still abides, though those who have reached it describe
it as a small village. Aquileia under its old
name, Forum Julii under its new name, are still inhabited,
they still hold the rank of towns; but while
they still abide, the rule that the first should become
last and the last first is carried out among them. As
ancient Aquileia was far greater than ancient Forum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Julii, so modern Aquileia, though it keeps its name,
is now far less than modern Cividale, from which the
name of Forum Julii has passed away.</p>

<p>Aquileia then, once the greatest city of all, is the
city that has come nearest to being altogether wiped
out of being. Venice, afterwards the greatest of all,
is the city which may most truly be said to have
been called out of nothing in after-times. Among
the other cities the change has been rather a change
of relation and proportion, than a case of absolute
birth and death. Cividale is still there, though it is
but a poor representative of Forum Julii. Udine has
taken its place. But Udine, though its importance
belongs wholly to mediæval times, was not strictly
a mediæval creation. It is just possible to prove
the existence of <i>Vedinum</i> in Roman days, though
it is only its existence which can be proved; it
plays no part whatever in early history. The case
is slightly different with another neighbouring city,
the Roman Tarvisium, whose name gradually changed
to <i>Treviso</i>. Tarvisium was of more account than
Vedinum, but it first comes into notice in the wars
of Belisarius, and its position as an important city
playing a part in Italian history dates only from the
days of the Lombard League. And its general
history is one in which the shifting nomenclature
of the district may be read with almost grotesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
accuracy. It has not only been, like its neighbours,
Venetian and Austrian in two widely different senses&mdash;it
has not only been Venetian in the old geographical
sense, and Venetian in the sense of being
subject to the commonwealth of Venice&mdash;it has not
only been Austrian in the old Lombard sense, and
Austrian in the sense of being subject to the Dukes
of the German Austria&mdash;but it has also shifted
backwards and forwards between the rule of the
Serene Republic and the rule of the Austrian Dukes,
in a way to which it would not be easy to find a
parallel even among the old revolutions of its
neighbours.</p>

<p class="p2">Treviso and its district, the march which bears its
name, was the first possession of Venice on the true
mainland of Italy, as distinguished from that mere
fringe of coast along the lagoons which may be more
truly counted as part of her dominion by sea. That
Treviso lay near to Venice was a truth which came
home to Venetian minds at a very early stage of
Venetian history. Even in the eleventh century, the
earliest authentic chronicler of Venice, that John whose
work will be found in the seventh volume of Pertz,
speaks with some significance, even when recording
events of the time of Charles the Great, of "quædam
civitas non procul a Venetia, nomine Tarvisium."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
When strictly Italian history begins, Treviso runs
through the ordinary course of a Lombard city; it
takes its share in resistance to the imperial power, it
falls into the hands of tyrants of the house of Romano
and of the house of Scala. Along with Padua, it is
the city which is fullest of memories of the terrible
Eccelinò. Won by the Republic in 1338 from its
lord Mastino della Scala, the special strangeness of
its fortunes begins. The modern House of Austria was
already in being; but its Dukes had not yet grown into
Emperors, one only had grown into an acknowledged
King. They had not won for themselves the crowns
of Bohemia or Hungary, though, by the opposite
process, one Bohemian king, the mighty Ottocar, had
counted Austria in the long list of his conquered lands.
But presently Treviso becomes the centre of events in
which Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, and the Empire, all
play their parts. It is perhaps not wonderful when
the maritime republic, mistress of the Trevisan march,
vainly seeks to obtain the confirmation of her right
from the overlord of Treviso though not of Venice,
Charles of Bohemia, King of the Romans and future
Emperor. But the old times when Huns, Avars,
Magyars, barbarians of every kind, poured into this
devoted corner of Italy, seem to have come back, when
in 1356 we find Treviso besieged by a Hungarian
king. But the Hungarian king is no longer an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
outside barbarian; he is a prince of the house of Anjou
and Paris. If Lewis the Great besieged Treviso, it
was not in the character of a new Attila or Arpad;
he attacked the now Venetian city as part of the war
which he so successfully waged against the Republic
in her Dalmatian lands. Not thirty years later we find
the Doge Andrew Contarini, with more wisdom perhaps
than the more famous Foscari of the next age, considering
that to Venice the sea was greater than the land,
and therefore commending her new conquest on the
mainland to Duke Leopold of Austria. The words
of the chronicler Andrew Dandolo are worth remembering.
They express the truest policy of the Republic,
from which she ought never to have gone astray.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Ducalis excellentia prudentissima, meditatione considerans proprium
Venetorum esse mare colere, terramque postergare; hinc enim
divitiis et honoribus abundat, inde sæpe sibi proveniunt scandala et
errores."</p>

<p>But Leopold, he who fell at Sempach, had not the
same passion for dominion south of the Alps as some
of his successors. He wisely sold Treviso to the lord
of Padua, Francesco Carrara, from whom, after a moment
of doubt whether the prize would not pass to the
tyrant of Milan, the Republic won it back after eight
years' separation. Henceforward Treviso shared the
fate of the other Venetian possessions which gradually
gathered on each side of her. Having had for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
moment its share of Austrian dominion in the fourteenth
century, Treviso was able, in the wars of the
sixteenth century, to withstand the same power in a
new shape, the power of Maximilian, Austrian Archduke
and Roman King. In later times nothing distinguishes
the city from the common course by which
Treviso and her neighbours became Austrian, French,
and Austrian again, till, by the happiest change of all,
they became members of a free and united Italy.</p>

<p class="p2">In the aspect of the city itself, the Roman Tarvisium
has left but small signs of its former being. All that
we see is the Treviso of mediæval and later times.
The walls, the bell-towers, the slenderer tower of the
municipal palace, the arcaded streets, the houses too,
though they are not rich in the more elaborate forms
of Italian domestic art, have all the genuine character
of a mediæval Italian town. Not placed in any
striking position, not a hill-city, not in any strictness
a river-city, but a city of the plain looking towards
the distant mountains&mdash;not adorned by any building
of conspicuous splendour&mdash;Treviso is still far from
being void of objects which deserve study. As we
look on the city, either from the lofty walk into which
so large a part of its walls have been turned, or else
from the neighbourhood of its railway station, its
aspect, without rivalling that of the great cities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Italy, is far from unsatisfactory. But the character of
the city differs widely in the two views. From the
station the ecclesiastical element prevails. The main
object in the view from this side is the Dominican
church of Saint Nicolas, one of those vast brick friars'
churches so characteristic of Italy, and to which the
praise of a certain stateliness cannot be denied. Saint
Nicolas, with its great bell-tower, groups well with
the smaller church and smaller tower of a neighbouring
Benedictine house. In short, the towers of
Treviso form its leading feature, and that, though
several of the greatest, above all the huge campanile
designed for the cathedral church, have never been
finished. In the view from the railway Saint Nicolas'
tower is dominant; the tall slender tower of the municipal
palace, loftier, we suspect, in positive height,
fails to balance it. In the other view, from the wall
on the other side, the municipal tower is the leading
object, which it certainly would not have been if the
bell-tower of the <i>duomo</i> had ever been carried up.
There is a great friars' church on this side too, the
desecrated church of Saint Francis; but, though a
large building with marked outline, it does not stand
out at all so conspicuously as its Dominican rival on
the other side. The <i>duomo</i> itself, with its eccentric
cupolas, goes for less in the general view than either.
On the whole, the aspect of Treviso is very characteristically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Italian; it would be yet more so if it sent
up its one great campanile to mark its site from afar.
Still, even as it is, this city of the Lombard Austria
proclaims itself as one of the same group as those
cities further to the west which we look down on side
by side from the castle-hill of Brescia.</p>

<p>Treviso, so near a neighbour of Venice, the earliest
of her subject cities of the mainland, does not fail to
proclaim the relation between the subject and the
ruling commonwealth in the usual fashion. The
winged lion, the ensign which we are to follow along
so many shores, appears on not a few points of her
defences. Over the gate of Saint Thomas the badge
of the Evangelist appears in special size and majesty,
accompanied, it would seem, by several younger members
of his family whose wings have not yet had time
to grow. And Treviso too in some sort calls up the
memory of its mistress in the abundance of streams,
canals, and bridges. It has at least more right than
some of the towns to which the guide-books give the
name, to be called a little Venice. But the contrast
is indeed great between the still waters of the
lagoons and the rushing torrents which pass under
the walls and turn the mills of Treviso. Venice, in
short, though her name has been rather freely scattered
about hither and thither, remains without likeness or
miniature among either subjects, rivals, or strangers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>The heart of an Italian city is to be looked for in its
town-house and the open space before it. It is characteristic
of the mistress of Treviso that her palace,
the palace of her rulers, not of her people, stands
somewhat aside from the great centre of Venetian life.
The church of the patron saint who had become
identified with the commonwealth takes in some sort
the place which in more democratic states belongs to
the home of the commonwealth itself. Technically
indeed Saint Mark's is itself part of the palace; it
answers to Saint Stephen's at Westminster, not to
Saint Peter's; but nowhere else among commonwealths
does the chapel of the palace in this sort
surpass or rival the palace itself. The less famous
Saint Liberalis, patron of the city and diocese of
Tarvisium, does not venture, after the manner of the
Evangelist, thus to supplant Tarvisium itself. The
commonwealth fully proclaims its being in the group
of municipal buildings which surround the irregular
space which forms the municipal centre of the city.
One alone of these, at once in some sort the oldest
and the newest, calls for special notice. The former
<i>palazzo della Signoria</i>, now the palace, the centre, in
the new arrangement of things, not only of the city
of Treviso but of the whole province of which it is
the head, has been clearly renewed, perhaps rebuilt.
But it keeps the true character of a Lombard building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of the kind, the simpler and truer forms which were
in vogue before the Venetian Gothic set in. It marks
the true position of that style that, though we cannot
help admiring many of its buildings when we look at
them, we find it a relief when we come to something
earlier and more real. The buildings of which Venice
set the type are very rich, very elegant; but we feel
that, after all, England, France, Germany, could all
do better in the way of windows, and that Italy
left to herself could do better in the way of columns
and arches. Old or new, rebuilt or simply repaired,
there is nothing very wonderful in the municipal
palace of Treviso; but in either case it is pleasing
as an example of the genuine native style of Italy.
It has arcades below, groups of round-headed windows
above, and the tower looks over the palace with the
more effect, because it is not parallel to it. The
arcades of the palace, continued in the form of the
arcades of the streets, are a feature of Treviso, as of
all other southern cities that were built by rational
men in rational times, and were designed, unlike
Venice and Curzola, for the passage of carriages and
horses. At Treviso we have arcades of all kinds, all
shapes, all dates, some rude enough, some really
elegant, but all of them better than the portentous
folly which has offered up modern Rome and modern
Athens as helpless victims to whatever powers may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
be conceived to preside over heat, dust, and their
consequences. Treviso is not a first-class Italian city;
it is hardly one of the second class; but it is pleasant
to thread one's way through the arcades, to try to
spell out the geography of the streams that are
crossed by many bridges; it is pleasant to mount
here and there on the wall, to look down on the
broad foss below, and across it on the rich plain with
its wall of mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>In the ecclesiastical department what there is of
any value above ground belongs mainly to the friars.
The interest of the <i>duomo</i>, as a building, lies wholly
in its crypt, a grand and spacious one, certainly not
later than the twelfth century. It may be that some
of the smaller marble shafts which support its vault
had already done duty in some earlier building, and
there is no doubt as to the classical date of a fragment
of a large fluted column which in this same crypt
serves the purpose of a well. The church above has
been mercilessly Jesuited; yet, as it keeps more than
one cupola, those cupolas give it a certain dignity;
the stamp of Constantinople and Venice, of Périgueux
and Angoulême, is hard wholly to wipe out. Otherwise
a few tombs and a fine piece of mediæval gilded
wood-carving are about all that the church of Treviso
has to show. The great Dominican church has been
more lucky. The guide-book of Gsel-fels, commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the best of guide-books, but which cuts Treviso a
little short, rather sets one against it by saying that
it has been wholly modernized within. Repaired and
freshened up it certainly has been; but it can hardly
be said to have been modernized; the old lines seem
not to have been tampered with. And there is something
far from lacking in dignity in the effect of its
vast interior, even though its style be the corrupt
Gothic of Italy. One merit is that the arches which
spring from the huge pillars, though wide, are not
sprawling&mdash;not like those which those who do not dare
to think for themselves are called on to admire in the
nave of the Florentine <i>duomo</i>. Unlike the work of
Arnolfo, the Dominican church of Treviso does not
look one inch shorter or lower than it is. It has too
the interest of much contemporary painting and other
ornamental work. The smaller Benedictine church
hard by, whose bell-tower groups so well with Saint
Nicolas, employs in that bell-tower a trefoil arch, a
strange form to spring from mid-wall shafts. Within
there is not much to look at, beyond a tablet setting
forth the glories of the Benedictine order, how many
emperors, empresses, kings, queens, popes, cardinals,
archbishops, bishops, and so forth, belonged to it.
Dukes, marquesses, counts, and knights, were unnumbered.
It is a strange thought that to that countless
band Bec added the full manhood and long monastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
life of Herlwin, that Saint Peter of Shrewsbury and
Saint Werburh of Chester had severally the privilege
of enrolling Earl Roger and Earl Hugh, each for a
few days only, as members of the brotherhood of
Benedict and Anselm.</p>

<p>The other friars' church, that of Saint Francis, has
been less lucky than its Dominican rival. Desecrated
and partitioned, its inside is now inaccessible; the
outside promises well for a church of its own type.
Yet how feeble after all are the very best of these
Italian buildings which forsook their own native forms
for a hopeless attempt to reproduce the forms of other
lands. We are always told that Italian Gothic cannot
be Northern Gothic, because Italy is not like Northern
lands. True enough; but what that argument proves
is that Italy should have kept to her own natural
Romanesque, the true fruit of her own soil, and should
never have meddled with forms which could not be
transplanted in their purity. The great fact of Italian
architectural history is that the native style never was
thoroughly driven out, but that, alongside of the sham
Gothic, true Romanesque lived on to lose itself in the
earlier and better kind of <i>Renaissance</i>. The open
arcades of streets and houses, and the bell-towers of
the churches, largely remain really Romanesque in
style at all dates. For the working out of the same
law in greater buildings we must make our way south-eastward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
The chronicler of the eleventh century
hinted that Treviso was near to Venice, and the men
of the fourteenth century acted on the hint. But the
wise Doge, who a generation later told his people to
stick to the sea and leave the land behind, knew
better where the true subject and neighbour lands of
Venice lay. We cannot fully obey him as yet, as we
have still points on the Italian mainland to visit. But
we may still keep the true goal of our pilgrimage
before our eyes, and we may remember that the lands
which were most truly near to Venice were those lands,
subject and hostile, to which the path lay by her own
element. The lessons of which we begin to get a
glimpse at Treviso we shall not learn in their fulness
till we have reached the other side of Hadria.</p>

<h3>UDINE AND CIVIDALE.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Ought the antiquarian traveller who has taken up his
quarters at Udine and has thence made an expedition
to Cividale to counsel his fellow-inquirers to follow his
example in so doing or not? The answer to this
question may be well made largely to depend on the
state of the weather. It would be dangerous to say,
from an experience of two visits only, that at Udine
and Cividale it always either rains or has very lately
rained; but those are the only two conditions in
which we can speak of those places from personal
knowledge. Now it is wonderful how a heavy rain
damps the zeal of the most inquiring spirit, especially
if he be carrying on his inquiries by himself. If he
has companions, a good deal of wet may be shaken off
by the process of talking and laughing at the common
bad luck. If he be alone, every drop sticks; he has
nothing to do but to grumble, and he has nobody to
listen to his grumblings but himself. The land may
be beautiful, but its beauties are half hid; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
buildings may have the most taking outlines, but
it is impossible to make a drawing of them. Even
interiors lose their cheerfulness; the general gloom
makes half their details invisible; and his own
depression of spirit makes the inquirer less able than
usual to understand and appreciate what he can see.
Udine and Cividale on a fine day are something quite
unlike Udine and Cividale in the rain. But even in
this more cheerful state of things, when the rain has
to be spoken of in the past tense, it may happen that
the past puts serious difficulties in the way of the
enjoyment of the present. Cividale is undoubtedly
more pleasant and more profitable to see when the
rain is past than when the rain is actually falling.
But then, to judge from our two experiences, Cividale
is easier to get at while the rain is actually falling
than when it has ceased to fall. What in the one
state of things is the half-dry <i>ghiara</i> of an Alpine
stream becomes a flood covering the road for no small
distance, and suggesting, to all but the most zealous,
the thought of turning back. It is only those for
whom the attractions of the spot which once was the
Forum Julii are strong indeed, who will pluck up
heart to go on when their carriage has sometimes to
be helped on by men who are used to wade through
the flood, or else is forced to leave what should have
been the high road for a narrow and difficult path
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
across the fields. It is well to record these things,
that those who stay at home may be put in mind that,
even in perfectly civilized lands, topographical knowledge
is not always to be got without going to some
little trouble in the search after it. We have seen
Udine and Cividale wet, and we have seen them dry,
but then it was when they had been wet only a very
short time before. We are tempted to think that we
might understand them better at some time when the
rainfall was neither of the present nor of the very
recent past.</p>

<p>One thing however is certain, that, wet or dry, not
many Englishmen make the experiment of trying to
find out what this corner of Italy may have to show.
Not an English name, save that of one specially
famous and adventurous traveller, was to be seen in
the visitors' book, either in Albergo dell' Italia at
Udine or in the Museum at Cividale. The true
traveller is always in a doubtful state of mind when
he finds a place of interest neglected by his own
countrymen. On the one hand he is personally
relieved, as being set free from the gabble of English
tourists at <i>tables d'hôte</i> and the like. But how far ought
he to proclaim to the world the merits of the place
which he has found out for himself? How can he
draw the line, so as to lead travellers to come, without
holding out the least inducement to mere tourists?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
But perhaps the danger is not great; tourists will go
only where it is the fashion to go, and the historical
traveller must not think of himself more highly than
he ought to think or fancy that it is for such as he to
create a fashion.</p>

<p class="p2">We will suppose then that our traveller has started
from Treviso, and has reached the frontier town of
Italy in the modern sense of the name. We have
seen that the existence of the place in Roman times
under the name of Vedinum can be proved and no
more. The importance and history of Udine, <i>Utinum</i>,
are wholly mediæval. It takes the place of Forum
Julii as the capital of Friuli the district which keeps
the name which has passed away from the city. It
is one of the eccentricities of nomenclature that the
other Forum Julii in southern Gaul has kept its
name, but in the still more corrupted shape of <i>Fréjus</i>.
The new head of the Venetian borderland&mdash;Venetia
in the older sense&mdash;went through the usual course of
the neighbouring cities with one feature peculiar to
itself. Not a patriarchal see, Udine was a patriarchal
capital, the capital of the patriarchs of Aquileia in
that temporal character which for a long while made
the bishops of the forsaken city the chief princes of
that corner of Italy.</p>

<p>Like Treviso, but somewhat later, Udine had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
undergo a Hungarian siege, when the Magyar crown
had passed by marriage from the house of Anjou
to the house of Luxemburg. But we may mark
how the different powers which had something to
do with the lands with which we are concerned are
already beginning to gather from the same hands.
Lewis, the enemy of Treviso in 1356, purely western in
origin, was purely eastern in power&mdash;King of Hungary
and of the lands round about Hungary, King of
Poland by a personal union. Siegmund, the enemy
of Udine in 1411, was already King of Hungary,
Margrave of Brandenburg also, in days when, as
Hungary had nothing to do with Austria, so Brandenburg
had nothing to do with Prussia. He was
already chosen but not crowned King of the Romans;
he was to be, before he had done, King of Bohemia,
reformer of the Church, and Emperor, last crowned
Emperor not of the Austrian house. Presently the
city passed away from the rule of the patriarchs,
but it could hardly be said to pass from a spiritual
to a temporal lord when it came under the direct
superiority of the Evangelist and his Lion. In the
war of the League of Cambray it passed for a moment
into the hands of an Austrian Archduke, but
one who wore the crown of Aachen, and bore the titles
of Rome without her crown. The first momentary
master saw from the German Austria that Udine was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Maximilian, King of Germany and Emperor-elect.
In the eighteenth century the patriarchs of Aquileia
had become harmless indeed, so harmless that their
dignity could be altogether swept away, and their
immediate province divided between the two new
archbishoprics of Udine and Gorizia. Thus Udine,
having once been the temporal seat of an ecclesiastical
prince of the highest rank, came, as a subject city,
to hold the highest ecclesiastical rank short of that
which was swept away to make room for its elevation.</p>

<p class="p2">Udine is one of those places which keep fortifications
of what we may call the intermediate period,
what, in this part of the world, is specially the Venetian
period. Such walls stand removed alike from
those which, even when not Roman in date, closely
follow the Roman type of defences, and from fortifications
of the purely modern kind. The walls of
Udine are well preserved and defended with ditches,
and, as they fence in a large space and as there
is comparatively little suburb, they form a prominent
feature in the aspect of the town. Within
the town, towering over every other object, is the
castle or citadel, as unpicturesque a military structure
as can be conceived, but perched on a huge mound,
like so many of the castles of our own land. Here
is work for Mr. Clark. Is the mound natural or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
artificial? Tradition says that it was thrown up
by Attila, that he might stand on it and see the
burning of Aquileia. Legendary as such a tale is on
the face of it, it may perhaps be taken as some
traditional witness to the artificial nature of the
mound. It would be dangerous to say anything more
positively without minute knowledge both of the
geology and of the præ-historic antiquities of Venetia;
but analogy always suggests that such mounds are
artificial, or at least largely improved by art. Anyhow
there the mound is, an earthwork which, if
artificial it be, the Lady of the Mercians herself
need not have been ashamed of.</p>

<p>Some of the guide-books call Udine "a miniature
Venice;" it is not easy to see why. There are some
canals and bridges in Udine, but so there are in Milan,
Amiens, and countless other towns. There is even a
Rialto; but one hardly sees how it came by its name.
The true "piccola Venezia" is far away in Dalmatia,
floating on its islands in the bay of Salona. The point
of likeness to Venice is probably found in the civic
palace and the two neighbouring columns. But these
last are only the usual badges of Venetian rule, and
the palace, though it may suggest the dwelling of the
Doges, has no more likeness to it than is shared by
many other buildings of the same kind in Italy. But,
like or unlike to Venice, there is no doubt, even on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
rainy day, that the palace of Udine is a building of no
small merit; on a fine day it might perhaps make us
say that it was worth going to Udine to see it. It is,
of course, far smaller than the Doges' palace; and if it
lacks the wonderful intermediate story of the Venetian
building, it also lacks the ugly story above it. The
point of likeness, if any, lies in the arcades, with their
columns of true Italian type, slenderer than those at
Venice, and using the pointed arch in the outer and
the round arch in the inner range. But the columns
at Udine are not a mere range like those at Venice.
They stand row behind row, almost like the columns
of a crypt, and they supply a profitable study in their
floriated capitals. The pillared space forms the market-place
of the city, and a busy place it is at the times
of buying and selling, filled with the characteristic
merchandise of the district, the golden balls of silk,
for whose presence the Venetian land may thank the
adventurous monks of Justinian's day. Some of the
columns, and a large part of the rest of the building,
had been renewed between 1875 and 1881. Between
those years the palace had been nearly destroyed by
fire. Here was a case of necessary restoration. No
rational person could have been better pleased, either
if the palace had been left in ruins or if it had been
repaired in some incongruous fashion. In such a case
as this, the new work is as much in its place as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
old, and the new work at Udine is as worthy as any
new work is ever likely to be to stand side by side
with the old. At Udine again, as in many other
places, the thought cannot fail to strike us how
thoroughly these grand public palaces of Italy do
but set before us, on a grand scale and in a more
ornamented style, a kind of building of which a
humble variety is familiar enough among ourselves.
Many an English market-town has an open market-house
with arches, with a room above for the administration
of justice or any other public purpose. Enlarge
and enrich a building of this kind, and we come by
easy steps to the palace of Udine and to the palace of
Venice.</p>

<p>The civic palace is the only building of any great
architectural value in Udine. The metropolitan
church contains little that is attractive for antiquity
or for beauty of the higher kind. But the interior,
though of mixed and corrupt style, is not without a
certain stateliness, and its huge octagonal tower would
have been a grand object if its upper stages had been
carried up in a manner worthy of its basement. The
streets are largely arcaded; and if the arcades of
Udine supply less detail than those of some other
Italian cities, any arcade is better than none. Udine
can at least hold its head higher than modern Bari,
modern Athens, modern Rome. Still at best Udine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
in itself holds but a secondary place among Italian
cities, and its main historic interest consists in the
way in which the utterly obscure <i>Vedinum</i> contrived
to supplant both Aquileia and Forum Julii. As
things now are, Forum Julii, dwindled to Cividale,
has become a kind of appendage to Udine, and we
must make our way thither from what is now the
greater city.</p>

<p class="p2">Let us here put on record the memories of an
actual journey, as strengthened and corrected by a
later one made under more favourable circumstances.
The accounts in the common guide-books are so
meagre, and it is so impossible to get any topographical
books in Udine, that our inquirer sets out,
it must be confessed, with the vaguest notions of
what he is going to see. Gsel-fels was not in those
days, and, now that he has come into being, he has
treated the lands at the head of the Hadriatic a good
deal less fully than he has done most other parts of
Italy. The traveller then is promised a store of
Roman remains by one guide-book, and an early
Romanesque church by another. He knows that the
greatness of Forum Julii has gone elsewhere, and he
is perhaps led to the belief that he is going to see a
fallen city, perhaps another Aquileia, perhaps even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
another Salona. One thing is clear, even in the rain&mdash;namely,
that the natural surroundings of Forum
Julii are of the noblest kind. The grand position
of the place itself he will not find out till later;
but the mist half hides, half brings out, the fact
that Udine lies near, and Cividale lies nearer, to
the great range of the Julian Alps. Here and
there their outlines can be made out; here and there
a snowy peak shows itself for a moment in the
further distance. A fertile plain with a mountain
barrier, with broad and rushing rivers to water it&mdash;it
was clearly a goodly land in which the old Veneti
had fixed themselves, and in which Rome fixed the
Forum of Julius as a colony and garrison to keep
their land in obedience.</p>

<p>A long and flat road, but with the mountains ever
in front, leads on by several villages with their bell-towers,
over what, according to the accidents of weather,
may be either a half-dry <i>ghiara</i> or a deep flood, till
the traveller reaches the place which was Forum
Julii, and which is Cividale. Here he finds himself&mdash;a
little to his amazement&mdash;in a living town, with
walls and gates and towers, with streets and houses
and churches, none of them certainly of the Julian
æra. The town is not very large; it is not a local
capital like Udine; still it is a town, not a village
among ruins and fragments like Aquileia and Salona.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
But it is plain that Cividale has not forgotten what
she once was; the traveller is set down at the <i>Grande
Albergo al Friuli</i>, and the <i>albergo</i> stands in the <i>Piazza
Giulio Cesare</i>. He remembers the like name at Rimini,
and he begins to cherish hopes that the treasures of
Rimini may have their like at Cividale. In utter
ignorance of what the place may really contain, he
seeks for a bookseller's shop, hoping that some guide-book
or plan of some kind may still be found. The
bookseller is soon found, but his shop contains nothing
of the least profit to an inquirer into the remains of
Forum Julii. But the traveller hears that there is
a museum; that promises something: besides the
treasures which the museum itself may contain, such
a place commonly implies an intelligent keeper, who
sometimes proves to be a scholar of a high order.
But he takes a wrong turn; no great harm however,
as he thereby learns sooner than he otherwise would
have learned the noble natural site of Cividale, planted
on the rocky banks of the rushing stream of the
Natisone. He sees two or three unpromising churches,
and looks into the chief of them, a building of strange
and mixed style, but not without a certain stateliness of
general effect. He sees the <i>Via Cornelio Gallo</i>, which
promises something, and the <i>Via del Tempio</i>, which
promises more. Visions of Nîmes, Vienne, and Pola
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
rise before him; he follows the track, but he finds
nothing in the least savouring of Jupiter or Diana,
and he learns afterwards that the <i>Tempio</i> from which
the street is called is the great church, known, it
seems, in a special way, as <i>Templum Maximum</i>. Still
the museum is not reached; but a second inquiry, a
second journey to quite another end of the town,
leads to it. The museum is examined; it contains
a considerable stock of objects of the usual kind,
fragments of architecture and sculpture, which witness
to the former greatness of Forum Julii. More remarkable
are the specimens of Lombard workmanship, in
various forms of armour and ornament, to say nothing
of the actual tomb of the Lombard Duke Gisulf. At
the museum he is put under the friendly guidance of a
kindly priest, by whose care many matters are cleared
up. Roman remains, strictly so called, there are none
to see. There have been diggings, and the walls have
been traced out, but all has been covered up again;
outside the museum there is nothing in the pagan
line left. But of Romanesque work the remains,
though neither large nor many, are of high interest.
Buried in an Ursuline nunnery, of which the good
father opens the door, is a small Romanesque church
of most singular design, built, so he tells us, in 764,
but which, if so, must have received some further
enrichment in the twelfth century. The sculptures in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the western wall are surely of the later date; but the
shell, parts of which in their coupled Corinthian
columns strongly call to mind some of the ancient
churches of Rome, may well be of the earlier date, of
the last days of the Lombard kingdom.</p>

<p>Here at last something of no small value has been
lighted on. As a matter of architecture, this church
is by far the best thing in Cividale. Indeed, as a
matter of architecture strictly so called, it is the only
thing of any importance. But let the other churches
be gone through again, perhaps only with that relief of
the mind which follows the discovery of an intelligible
clue, yet more when old memories are revived and
strengthened by a second visit, and, though they are
of no great value as buildings, they are found to be
of no small interest in other ways. The <i>Templum
Maximum</i> indeed, late and corrupt as is its style, is
not without a certain grandeur of internal effect, and
it contains more than one object which calls up
historic memories. There is the chair which cannot
in strictness be called patriarchal, but which was
doubtless used by patriarchs when the spiritual shepherds
of Aquileia fled from their wasted home to the
safer shelter of Forum Julii, and ruled its chief
church as provosts. There too on the altar we may see
the silver image work of the twelfth century, the gift
of one of the two patriarchs who bore the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Peregrinus. And there too is a wonderful object,
the indoor baptistery&mdash;for it is more than a font&mdash;repaired
two years after Charles the Great had added
the style of King of the Lombards to his Frankish
kingship and his Roman patriciate. We may then
believe that, in the columns and round arches of its
octagon, we see work of the date when the land of
Forum Julii was still the Austria of an independent
Lombard realm. Other objects of early days are to be
found in even the less promising churches, specially
an altar, rich with the goldsmith's craft, which suggests,
though it does not rival, the altar of Saint
Ambrose at Milan. But first among the treasures of
Cividale must rank the precious volume which is still
guarded in the treasury of the great church. This is
an ancient book of the gospels, now of three gospels
only, for some zealous Venetian, eager for the honour
of Saint Mark, deemed that the pages which contained
his writings were out of place anywhere except
in the Evangelist's own city. The highest historical
value of the book consists in the crowds of signatures
scattered through its margin, signatures of persons
great and small, known and unknown, from the days
of the Lombard princes to the Empress-Queen of the
last age and the Bourbon pretender of the present.
When we have grasped the fact that the popular
speech of the surrounding district is Slavonic, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
are less surprised than we otherwise might be to find
that a large proportion of the signatures come from
eastern Europe. Among them are a crowd of signatures
from Bulgaria, headed by Michael their king.
It is for palæographers to judge of the date by the
writing. And palæographers say that, of the ancient
names, none are earlier than the end of the eighth
century or later than the end of the tenth. Otherwise
we might have been driven to see in this Michael
nothing greater than a fourteenth century king of an
already divided Bulgaria. But the great Simeon of
an earlier day left a son Michael, a monk, who left
his monastery to strive vainly for his father's crown.
Yet, if the witness of wise men as to the dates of the
writing may be trusted, it must be either the signature
of this Michael or else an utter forgery. But
the unenlightened in such matters asks how the
signatures of men of so many lands and ages got
there. Did those whose names were written&mdash;for of
course few, if any, would write them themselves&mdash;come
to the book, or did the book go to them? The
earlier signatures at least are said to be the names of
reconciled enemies who took the holy book to witness
that their enmities were laid aside. This we can
neither affirm nor deny, but it surely cannot apply to
all the signatures in the book. The treasury contains
other ancient books, and other objects which are well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
worth notice, but this strange and precious relic is
the chiefest of them all.</p>

<p>Altogether then there turns out to be a good deal
to see on the site which once was Forum Julii. What
is to be seen is perhaps not exactly of the kind which
the traveller may have fancied in his dreams. He can
hardly have come expecting to find a stately mediæval
or modern city. He may have come expecting to find
the walls of a Roman city sheltering here and there
either Roman fragments or modern cottages. He will
find neither of these; but he will find a town whose
natural position is far more striking than could have
been looked for in the approach from Udine, and
whose chief merit is that it shelters here and there,
in corners where they have to be sought for, several
objects, neither Roman nor mediæval, but of the
darker, and therefore most instructive, period which
lies between the two.</p>

<h4>1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>At Udine and at Cividale we are still in Italy in
every sense which that name has borne since the
days of Augustus Cæsar. But the fact which may
have startled us at the last stage of our course, the
fact that a Slavonic tongue is to be heard within the
borders of both the old and the new Italian kingdom,
may suggest the thought that we are drawing near
to parts of the world which are in some respects
different from Treviso and the lands to the west of
it. We are about to pass from the subject lands of
Venice to the neighbour lands. We shall presently
reach the borders which modern diplomacy has decreed
for the Italian kingdom, seemingly because they were
the borders of the territory of the Venetian commonwealth
on the mainland. Venice, as Venice, has
passed away, but it is strange to see how one of
the most artificial of her boundaries survives. The
present arrangements of the European map seem to
lay down as the rule on this frontier that nothing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
was not Venetian can be Italian. The rule is purely
negative; no weight at all is given to the converse
doctrine that whatever was Venetian should be Italian.
Nor is it necessary to plead for any such doctrine, a
doctrine which nationality and geography, as well as
practical possibility, would all decline to support.
Still it is hard to see why the negative doctrine
should be so strictly pressed, and why Italian lands
should be forced to remain under a foreign dominion,
simply because they never came under the dominion
of Venice. If any argument grounded in this way on
facts which have long since ceased to have a meaning
were urged on the Italian side, it would be at once
scouted as pedantic and antiquarian. But it would
seem that even pedantry and antiquarianism are
welcomed when they tell on behalf of the other side.
For surely it is the height of pedantry and antiquarianism
to argue that, because a land was never
numbered among the subject provinces of Venice,
it therefore may not be numbered among the equal
members of a free Italian kingdom. It is certainly
hard to find any other reason, except that the advance
of Venice stopped at a certain point, to account for
the fact that the dominions of a foreign prince come
so awkwardly near to Verona, for the fact that Trent
and Roveredo look to Vienna and not to Rome.
Such are our thoughts on one line of journey; on our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
present course the same question suggests itself
again. We pass a frontier where it is not at first
sight easy to see why any frontier should be there.
We journey from Udine to Gorizia, still keeping
within the old Lombard Austria, but between Udine
and Gorizia lies Cormons, and after Cormons we find
ourselves in a new Austria. We speak with geographical
accuracy. We might not say, as some would,
that we were in Austria if we were at Cattaro or at
Tzernovitz, but in the land which we have now
entered, we are, not indeed in the archduchy of
Austria, but within the circle of Austria according
to the arrangements of Maximilian. And in truth
we do soon mark a change. We soon come to feel
more distinctly than before that we are in a land
where more tongues than one are spoken. We may
have found out that round about Cividale all is not
Italian in speech; but the Slavonic tongue of those
parts is modest and retiring. It does not thrust
itself into print or show itself flauntingly on doors
or windows. But when we pass the border, when
we are in the land which is Austrian both in the
oldest and the newest sense, the presence of a twofold,
even of a three-fold, speech makes itself very
clear. At Cividale, if Slavonic was to be heard, it
was at least not to be seen. In the city which we
next reach, Italian and Slavonic are both to be seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
openly, and a third tongue is to be seen alongside
of them. Are we to seek here for the justification
of the frontier which struck us as artificial and
needless? Is the fact that the Slavonic tongue is
spoken in or close by the city which we next reach a
proof that that city ought to remain outside the
Italian kingdom? If so, the argument might be
thought to prove too much; it might be thought to
prove that Cividale ought not to be counted to Italy
any more than its neighbour. But any one who took
up this line of argument would hardly be led by it to
approval of things as they are. The Panslavist who
should go the length of arguing that neither Gorizia
nor Cividale ought to look to Rome as its head would
hardly argue that either of them ought to look to
Vienna.</p>

<p>We have written the name <i>Gorizia</i>; but we have
written it with fear and trembling. For we have now
reached a city where we have three names to choose
from. Shall we say <i>Görz</i>, <i>Gorizia</i>, or <i>Gorici</i>? All
three names will be found carefully displayed side by
side in public notices. One is tempted, by the
analogy of a crowd of Slavonic names in other places,
to suggest <i>Goritaz</i> instead of any of them. But
<i>Gorici</i> is the Slavonic form as by law established, and
to that rule both natives and visitors may do well to
bow. In any case there is little doubt that on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
spot of many names we have reached a place which,
though Italian in geography, though for ages German
in allegiance, was in truth Slavonic in origin. A
charter of Otto the Third speaks of "una villa quæ
Sclavonica lingua vocatur Gorizia." This is the earliest
certain mention of the place. There is indeed a document
which tells us how in the year 949 Bishop John
of Trieste was borne down by many troubles, and how
one source of his troubles was a heavy debt to David
the Jew of Gorizia. But wise men reject the document
which asserts this piece of episcopal mismanagement.
And the way in which the place is spoken
of in the eleventh century does not sound as if it
could have been a spot whose wealth could have
drawn Jews thither in the tenth. In any case the
Slavonic <i>villa</i> grew into a town and a county of
the Empire, and late in the fifteenth century the
Counts of Gorizia became the same persons as
the Archdukes of Austria. But long after the beginning
of that union, the distinction between
Austria and Gorizia was still strongly drawn. How
much Gorizia still thought of itself, how much
its prince still thought of himself in his local character,
is made plain by the most prominent feature
of the chief building of the place. Over the gateway
of the castle is an inscription recording repairs done
in the year 1660 by the reigning Count Leopold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
That Count bore higher titles, and he does not fail
to record them on the stone; but they are recorded
in an almost incidental way. Letters boldly cut,
letters which catch the eye at some distance, proclaim
that the work was done by <span class="smcap">LEOPOLDUS COMES GORITIÆ</span>.
Go near, and you may literally read between the lines,
in smaller letters and abbreviated words, that this
Count Leopold happened to be also Emperor of the
Romans, King of Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia,
Archduke of Austria, and&mdash;in his own eyes at least&mdash;Duke
of Burgundy. But here at Gorizia he reigned
and built directly as Count of Gorizia, and he proclaimed
himself primarily by his local title. In an
inscription such things could be done; heraldry hardly
admitted of any such ingenious devices. The bird of
Cæsar must bear the hereditary shield of the prince
who has been chosen to the imperial office, and on
that hereditary shield the bearings of the Gorizian
county cannot displace those of duchies and kingdoms.
While therefore the legend proclaims the doer of the
repairs of 1660 as before all things a hereditary local
count, the shield proclaims him as before all things a
Roman Emperor-elect. Yet one may believe that
most of those who pass under the imperial bird over
the gateway deem him all one with his bastard likeness
over the tobacco-shops. Some may even fail to
see that, among the many hereditary bearings of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
elective Cæsar, the lion of the Austrian duchy keeps
his proper place. That lion is so apt to pass out of
sight, men are so ready to cry "Austria" when they
see the eagle of Rome, so little ready to cry "Austria"
when they see Austria's own bearing, that it may be
kind to point out one place where his form and his
occasional destiny may best be studied. The true
Austrian beast is plainly to be seen on the walls of the
<i>Schlachtkapelle</i> near Sempach, and his presence there
is explained by the legend, thrilling to the federal
and democratic mind, "Das Panier von Oestreich ist
gefangen, und ist nach Uri gekommen."</p>

<p>The eagle of Rome over the gateway, in a place
where in these regions we look almost mechanically
for the lion of Saint Mark, reminds us yet again that
we have passed from the subject into the neighbour
lands of Venice. And various inscriptions, public and
private, bring no less clearly home to our minds that
we are in a land of more than one tongue. Of the
three names of the town, that by which we have
hitherto spoken of it, that which it bears in the
earliest trustworthy charter, that which differs by one
letter only from its more ordinary Latin shape as
seen over the gate, is also the name which the traveller
will most frequently hear in its streets and will
see universally written over its shops. As far as one
can see at a glance, German is at <i>Görz</i> the tongue of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
hôtels, <i>cafés</i>, public departments of all kinds. Italian
is the tongue of the citizens of <i>Gorizia</i> whose shops
are sheltered by its street arcades. Slavonic, we conceive,
will some day be the tongue of the little children
who, in all the joy of a state of nature, as naked
as any other mammals, creep, as merrily though more
slowly than the lizards, over the grass and stones of
the castle-hill of <i>Gorici</i>. Anyhow Gorizia is, like
Palermo of old, the city of the threefold tongue.
But the place itself is, considering its history, a little
disappointing. Nothing indeed is lacking in the way
of position. Mountains on all sides, except where the
rich plain of the swift Isonzo stretches away to the
sea, fence in the city, without hemming it close in
as in a prison. One hill is crowned by the castle,
whence we look out on another crowned by the
long white line of the Franciscan convent, suggesting
memories of the banished king who was the last
to receive the consecrating oil of Rheims. Houses,
churches, villages, are thickly scattered over the plain
and the hill sides. The vines and the mulberry-trees,
the food of the silkworm whose endless cocoons
choke up the market-place, witness to the richness of
the land. But there is a strange lack of buildings of
any importance in this capital of an ancient county,
this resort which boasts itself as the "Nizza Austriaca,"
the "Oesterreichische Nizza"&mdash;in such formulæ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the third tongue of the spot is not called into
play. A Nizza without any Mediterranean may seem
as strange as the Rialto which we saw at Udine
without any Grand Canal. But Gorizia as a modern
town is not striking. Its best features are the old
arcades in some of its streets and markets. Such
arcades must be bad indeed to be wholly unsatisfactory,
and some of those at Gorizia are very fairly done.
But there is no grand church, no grand municipal
palace; the castle itself is not what on such a site it
ought to be. The castle is the kernel of the whole
place. Gorizia is not a hill-town, nor can we call it
a river-town. There is the castle on the hill, and the
town seems to have gathered at its foot. The castle
soars so commandingly over the country round that
we wish here, as at Udine, that there was something
better to soar than the ugly barrack which forms its
uppermost stage. There are indeed better things
within Count Leopold's gateway. The outer court is
laid out in streets, and contains several houses with
architectural features. One, bearing date 1475, with
respectable columns and round arches below, and with
windows of the Venetian type above, might pass for a
very humble following, not of the palaces of Venice
or Udine, but of the far nobler pile which is in store
for us at Ragusa. A small church too strikes us,
with its windows projecting like oriels, one of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
indeed rising from the ground. This last, when we
enter, proves to be the smallest of side-chapels set on
this fashion. In some cities such a small eccentricity
would hardly deserve any notice; but at Gorizia we
learn to become thankful for rather small mercies.</p>

<p>In the lower town what little interest there is
gathers round the pieces of street arcades; the
churches go for next to nothing. Yet Gorizia ranks
as an ecclesiastical metropolis, and it has its metropolitan
church no less than Canterbury or Lyons.
Nor is this merely one of those arrangements of the
present century which have stripped Mainz and Trier
of their immemorial dignity, and which have given
us archbishops of such unexpected places as Munich
and Freiburg-im-Breisgau. The style of Archbishop
of Gorizia is at least several generations older than
the style of Emperor of Austria. The church of
Gorizia rose to metropolitan rank, at the same time
as the church of Udine, when the patriarchate of
Aquileia came to an end, and its province was divided
between the two new metropolitans thus called into
being. But the seat of the modern primacy is hardly
worthy of a simple bishopric. There is nothing in
the building of any antiquity but a choir, German
rather than Italian, and of no great antiquity either.
The rest of the church is of a gaudy <i>Renaissance</i>;
yet it deserves some notice from the boldness of its
construction. It is designed, within and without, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
two stories: that is, the upper gallery is an essential
part of the building. The principle is the same as
in Saint Agnes and Saint Laurence at Rome, and as
in German churches like the Great Minster at Zürich;
but the feeling is quite different. Still, if a church is
to be built in a <i>Renaissance</i> style and to receive two sets
of worshippers, one over the heads of the other, it must
be allowed that the object is thoroughly attained in
the metropolitan church of Gorizia, and its architect is
entitled to the credit of having successfully grappled
with the problem immediately set before him.</p>

<p>Gorizia then can hardly claim, on the ground either
of its history or its buildings, to rank among cities of
the first, or even of the second class. Its natural
position far surpasses all that has been done in it, and
all that has been built in it. But there is no spot on
which men have lived for eight or nine hundred years
which does not teach us something, and Gorizia has
its lessons as well as other places. It would hardly
be worth making a journey thither from any distant
point to see Gorizia only; but the place should be
seen by any one whose course takes him through the
lands at the head of the Hadriatic. Udine, Cividale,
and Gorizia are places which have in some sort partitioned
among them the position of fallen Aquileia.
From the children, we might perhaps say the rebellious
children, we must go on to the ancient mother.</p>

<h3>AQUILEIA.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We have already, in our course through the lands at
the head of the Hadriatic, had need constantly to
refer to the fallen city which once was the acknowledged
head of those lands, the city whose fame began
as a great Roman colony, the bulwark of Italy at her
north-eastern corner, and which lived on, after the fall
of its first greatness, in the character of the nominal
head alike of a considerable temporal power and of
an ecclesiastical power whose position and history were
altogether unique. We have noticed that, while the
cities of this region rise and fall, still even those
which fall are not wholly swept away. Aquileia has
always lived, though, since the days of Attila, the life
of the actual city of Aquileia has been a very feeble
one indeed. But though Aquileia, as a city, practically
perished in the fifth century, yet it continued
till the eighteenth to give its name to a power of
some kind. Its temporal position passed to Forum
Julii, and Udine succeeded to the position alike of
Forum Julii and of Aquileia. But the patriarchs grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
into temporal princes, and their style continued to be
taken from Aquileia, and not from Forum Julii or
Udine. On the ecclesiastical side, the patriarchal title
itself arose out of a theological and a local schism.
And, while the bishops of Aquileia thus rose to the
same nominal rank as those of Constantinople and
Alexandria, they had, as the result of the same chain
of events, to see&mdash;at least, if they had gone on living
at Aquileia they would have seen&mdash;a rival power of
the same rank spring up, at their own gates, in the
form of the patriarchs of Grado. This last was surely
the greatest anomaly in all ecclesiastical geography.
He who is not familiar with the Italian ecclesiastical
map may be surprised to find Fiesole a separate
bishopric from Florence. Even he who is familiar
with such matters may still be surprised to find
Monreale a separate archbishopric from Palermo. But
even this last real anomaly seems a small matter,
compared with the arrangement which placed one
patriarch at Aquileia itself, and another almost within
a stone's throw at Aquileia's port of Grado. At every
step we have lighted on something to suggest the
thought of the ancient capital of the Venetian borderland;
we have now to look at what is left of the
fallen city itself. Setting aside the actual seats of
Imperial power, Rome Old and New, Milan, Trier,
and Ravenna, few cities stand out more conspicuously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
than Aquileia both in general and in ecclesiastical
history. The stronghold by which Rome first secured
her power over the borderland of Illyria and Cisalpine
Gaul&mdash;the city which grew under the fostering hand
of Augustus into one of the great cities of the Empire&mdash;the
city whose overthrow by Attila was one of the
causes of the birth of Venice&mdash;might have claimed
for itself no mean place in history, even if it had
never become one of the special seats of ecclesiastical
rule and ecclesiastical controversy. To see such a
city sunk to a mean village, to trace out the remains
of its ancient greatness and splendour, is indeed a
worthy work for the historical traveller.</p>

<p>But how shall the traveller find his way to Aquileia?
Let us confess to a certain degree of pious fraud in
our notices of Treviso, Udine, and Gorizia. We have,
for the general purposes of the series, conceived the
traveller as starting from Venice, while in truth those
notices contained the impressions of journeys made
the other way, with Trieste as their starting-point.
The mask must be thrown off, if only because the
journey to Aquileia always calls up the memory of
an earlier visit to Aquileia when it was also from
Trieste that another traveller set forth. We have
before us a record of travel from Trieste to Aquileia,
in which the pilgrim, finding himself on the road
"in a capital barouche behind two excellent horses,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
tells us that "the idea of thus visiting a church city,
which seemed a mere existence of the past, had something
so singular and inappropriate as to seem an
ecclesiastical joke. When at the octroi," he continues,
"our driver gave out his destination, the whole
arrangement produced the same effect in my mind
as if Saint Augustine had asked me to have a bottle
of soda-water, or Saint Jerome to procure for him a
third-class ticket." Without professing altogether to
throw ourselves into enthusiasm of this kind, the
ecclesiastical history of the city, its long line of
patriarchs, schismatical and orthodox, is of itself
enough to give Aquileia a high place among the
cities of the earth. But why Aquileia should be
called "a church city" as if it were Wells or Lichfield
or Saint David's, cities to which that name
would very well apply&mdash;why going thither should
seem an "ecclesiastical joke"&mdash;why Saint Augustine,
if he were still on earth, should be debarred from the
use of soda-water&mdash;why Saint Jerome should be condemned
to a third-class ticket, while his modern
admirer goes in a capital barouche behind two excellent
horses&mdash;all these are mysteries into which it
would not do for the profane to peer too narrowly.
But the traveller from whom we quote was one in
whose mind the first sight of Spalato called up no
memory of Diocletian, but who wandered off from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the organizer of the Roman power to an ecclesiastical
squabble in which the British Solomon was a chief
actor. We quote his own words. As he first saw the
mighty bell-tower, he asks, "What were our thoughts?
What but of poor Mark Antony de Dominis?"</p>

<p>Our ecclesiastical traveller who went straight from
Trieste to Aquileia in the barouche with the excellent
horses made his pilgrimage before the railway was
opened. As it is, the more modern inquirer is more
likely to take the train to Monfalcone&mdash;perhaps
humbly, like Saint Jerome, by the third class, perhaps
otherwise, according to circumstances. He will pass
through a land of specially stony hills coming down
near to the sea, but leaving ever and anon, in the
most utter contrast, green marshy places between the
stones and the water. Some may find an interest in
passing by Miramar, the dwelling of the Maximilian
who perished in Mexico; some may prefer to speculate
about Antenor, and to wonder where he found the nine
mouths of Timavus. But it is still possible to go
by the same path as our predecessor, and that antiquated
course has something to be said for it. The
road from Trieste to Aquileia is, for some while at
least, not rich in specially striking objects, but it
passes over lofty ground whence the traveller will
better understand the geography of the Hadriatic,
and will come in for some glimpses of the inland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
parts of this region of many tongues. For here it
is not quite enough to say that native Italian and
Slave and official German all meet side by side. We
are not far off from the march-land of two forms of
the Slavonic speech; the tongue of Rome too is
represented at no great distance by another of its
children, distinct from the more classic speech of
Italy. We remember that the Vlach, the Rouman,
the Latin-speaking remnant of the East, has settled
or has lingered at not very distant points. We are
tempted to fancy&mdash;wrongly, it may be&mdash;that some
of them must almost come within the distant landscape.
One thing is certain; bearers far more
strange of the Roman name, though no speakers of
the Roman tongue, are there in special abundance.
Those whom sixteenth century Acts of Parliament
spoke of as "outlandish persons calling themselves
Egyptians," though they certainly now at least no
more call themselves Egyptians than Englishmen
ever called themselves Saxons, are there as a distinct
element in the land. The traveller who comes on the
right day may come in for a gipsy fair at Duino; he
may hear philologers whose studies have lain that
way talking to them in their own branch of the
common Aryan tongue. He himself meanwhile, driven
to look at their outsides only, perhaps thinks that
after all gipsies do not look so very different from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
other ragged people. Certainly if he chances to be
making his way, as it is possible that he may be, from
Dalmatia and Montenegro, he will miss, both among
the gipsies and the other inhabitants of the land, the
picturesque costumes to which he has become used
further south. Duino itself, a very small haven, but
which once believed that it could rival Trieste, will,
to the antiquary at least, be more interesting than its
gipsy visitors. A castle on rocks, overhanging the
sea&mdash;a castle, so to speak, in two parts, one of which
contains a tower which claims a Roman date, while
the other is said to have sheltered Dante&mdash;will reward
the traveller who still keeps to the barouche and the
horses on his journey to the "church city," instead of
making use of the swifter means which modern skill
has provided for him.</p>

<p class="p2">At last, by whichever road he goes, the traveller
finds himself at the little town of Monfalcone, and
there he who comes by the railway must now look for
the capital barouche and the excellent horses, or such
substitutes for them as Monfalcone can supply. A
small castle frowns on the hill above the station, but
the town contains nothing but an utterly worthless
<i>duomo</i> and some street arcades, to remind us once more
that, if we are under the political rule of the Apostolic
King, we are on soil which is Italian in history and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
in architecture. After a railway journey which has
mainly skirted the sea, perhaps even after a journey
over the hills during a great part of which we have
looked down on the sea, we are a little surprised at
finding that the road which leads us to what once
was a great haven takes us wholly inland. We pass
through a flat and richly cultivated country, broken
here and there by a village with its campanile, till two
Corinthian columns catch the eye in front of a modern
building, which otherwise might be passed by without
notice. Those two columns, standing forsaken, away
from their fellows, mark that we have reached
Monastero; in the days before Attila we should have
reached Aquileia. We are now within the circuit of
the ancient colony. But mediæval Aquileia was shut
up within far narrower limits; modern Aquileia is
shut up within narrower limits still. Within the
courtyard of the building which is fronted by the two
columns, we find a large collection, a kind of outdoor
museum, of scraps of architecture and sculpture, the
fragments of the great city that once was. We go
on, and gradually our approach to the centre is
marked by further fragments of columns lying here
and there, as at Rome or Ravenna. A little farther,
and we are in modern Aquileia, "città Aquileia," as
it still proudly calls itself in the official description,
which, as usual, proclaims to the traveller the name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
of the place where he is, and in what administrative
division of the "Imperial and Royal" dominions he
finds himself.</p>

<p>Of the village into which the ancient colony has
shrunk up we must allow that the main existing
interest is ecclesiastical. So far as Aquileia is a city at
all, it is now a "church city." The patriarchal church,
with its tall but certainly not beautiful campanile,
soars above all. But, if it soars above all, it still is
not all. Here and there a fragment of a column, or
an inscription built into the wall, reminds us of what
Aquileia once was. One ingenious man has even
built himself an outhouse wholly out of such scraps,
here a capital, there a bit of sculpture, there inscriptions
of various dates, with letters of the best
and of the worst kinds of Roman lettering. Queer
and confused as the collection is, the bits out of which
it is put together are at least safe, which they would
not be if they were left lying about in the streets.
Another more regularly assorted collection will be
found in the local museum, which has the advantage of
containing several plans, showing the extent of the
city in earlier times. At last we approach the church,
now, and doubtless for many ages past, the one great
object in Aquileia. In front of it a single shattered
column marks the place of the ancient forum. To
climb the tower is the best way of studying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
geography of Aquileia, just as to climb the tower of
Saint Apollinaris is the best way of studying the
geography of Ravenna. In both cases the first
feeling that comes upon the mind is that the sea has
become a distant object. Now the eye ranges over a
wide flat, and the sea, which once brought greatness
to Aquileia, is far away. A map of Aquileia in the
fifteenth century is to be had, and it is wise to take it
to the top of the tower. There we may trace out
the churches, gates, and other buildings, which have
perished since the date of the map, remembering
always that the Aquileia of the fifteenth century was
the merest fragment of the vast city of earlier times.
A good deal of the town wall of the mediæval date
may still be traced. It runs near to the east end
of the church, acting, as at Exeter and Chichester,
as the wall at once of the town and of the ecclesiastical
precinct. The church itself, the patriarchal
basilica of Aquileia, is a study indeed, though the first
feeling on seeing it either within or without is likely
to be one of disappointment. We do not expect
outline, strictly so called, in an Italian church; when
we come in for any grouping of towers, such as we
see at Saint Abbondio at Como and at more wonderful
Vercelli, we accept with thankfulness the boon
which we had not looked for. So we do not complain
that the basilica of Aquileia, with its vast length and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
its lofty tower, is still, as judged by a northern eye,
somewhat shapeless. But in such a place we might
have expected to find a front such as those which form
the glory of Pisa and Lucca, such a tower as may be
found at Pisa and Lucca and at a crowd of places of
less renown. We enter the church, and we find
ourselves in a vast and stately basilica; but one
feature in its architecture at once amazes us. There
are the long rows of columns with which we have
become familiar at Pisa and Lucca, at Rome and
Ravenna; but all the main arches are pointed. And
the pointed arches are not, as at Palermo and indeed
at Pisa also, trophies of the vanquished Saracen;
their details at once show that they are actual
mediæval work. We search the history, for which
no great book-learning is needed, as inscriptions on
the walls and floor supply the most important facts.
The church was twice recast, once early in the eleventh
century, and again in the fourteenth. The pointed
work in the main building is of course due to this
last change; the crypt, with its heavy columns and
rude capitals, looks like work of the eleventh century,
though it has been assigned to the fifth, and though
doubtless materials of that date have been used up
again. And in the upper church also, the columns
of the elder building have, as so often happens,
lived through all repairs. Their capitals for the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
part are mediæval imitations of classical forms rather
than actual relics of the days before Attila. But
two among them, one in each transept, still keep
shattered Corinthian capitals of the very finest work.</p>

<p>The fittings of the church are largely of <i>Renaissance</i>
date, but the patriarchal throne remains, and there are
one or two fragments of columns and the like put to
new uses. On the north side of the nave is a singular
building, known as the <i>sacrario</i>, of which it is not easy
to guess the original purpose. It is a round building
supporting a miniature colonnade with a conical roof
above, so that it looks more like a model of a baptistery
than anything else. Those who see Cividale before
Aquileia may be reminded of the baptistery within
the <i>Templum Maximum</i>. But the Forojulian work
is larger than the Aquileian, and we can hardly fancy
that this last was really designed to be used for baptism;
at all events there is a notable baptistery elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the basilica of Aquileia we have three marked
dates, but we may call it on the whole a church of the
eleventh century, keeping portions of a church of
the fourth, and itself largely recast in the fourteenth.
Thus, setting aside later changes, the existing church
shows portions of work a thousand years apart, and
spans nearly the whole of Aquileian history. When
the rich capitals of the transepts were carved, the
days of persecution were still of recent memory; when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
pointed arches were set on the ancient columns, the
temporal power of the patriarchate was within a century
of its fall. The first church of Aquileia is assigned to
the bishop Fortunatian, who succeeded in 347, the last
prelate who held Aquileia as a simple bishopric without
metropolitan rank. The builder and consecrator of
the present church&mdash;for present we may call it, though
it shows less detail of his work than of either earlier
or later times&mdash;was Poppo or Wolfgang, patriarch
from 1019 to 1042, a man famous in local history
as the chief founder of the temporal power of the
patriarchate. His influence was great with the Emperors
Henry the Second and Conrad the Second; he
accompanied the latter prince to his Roman coronation,
and must therefore have stood face to face with our
own Cnut. The name of this magnificent prelate
suggests his namesake, who at the very same moment
filled the metropolitan throne of Trier, and was engaged
in the same work of transforming a great church of
an older day. If we compare Trier and Aquileia, we
see how men's minds are worked on by local circumstances
and local associations. Poppo of Aquileia and
Poppo of Trier were alike German prelates, but one
was working in Germany and the other in Italy. The
northern Poppo therefore gave the remodelled church
of Trier a German character, while the remodelled
church of Aquileia remained, under the hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the southern Poppo, a church thoroughly Italian. We
may even say that the essential character of the building
was not changed, even by the still later remodelling
which brought in the pointed arches; these were
the work of Markquard of Randeck, who was translated
from Augsburg to the patriarchal see in 1365, and
who held it till 1381. He brought in the received
constructive form of his day, but he did not by bringing
in pointed arches turn the building into Italian Gothic.
The church of Markquard remained within and without
a true basilica, keeping the general effect of the church
of Poppo, perhaps even of the church of Fortunatian.
The walls of the church moreover show inscriptions of
much later date, recording work done in the church
of Aquileia in the days of Apostolic sovereigns of our
own time. The newest of all, which was not there in
1875, but which was there in 1881, bears the name
of the prince who has ceased to be lord of Forum
Julii, but who still remains lord of Aquileia.</p>

<p>But the basilica itself is not all. A succession of
buildings join on to the west: first a <i>loggia</i>, then
a plain vaulted building, called, but without much
likelihood, an older church, which leads to the
ruined baptistery. The old map shows this last with
a high roof or cupola, and then the range from the
western baptistery to the great eastern apse must
have been striking indeed. Fragments of every kind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
columns, capitals, bits of entablature, lie around; and
to the south of the church stand up two great pillars,
the object of which it is for some local antiquary to
explain. The old map shows that they stood just
within the court of the patriarchal palace, which was
then a ruin, and which has now utterly vanished.
They are not of classical work; they are not columns
in the strict sense; they are simply built up of stones,
like the pillars of Gloucester or Tewkesbury. Standing
side by side, they remind us of the columns which
in towns which were subject to Venice commonly bear
the badges of the dominion of Saint Mark. But can
we look for such badges at Aquileia? The lands of
the patriarchate, in by far the greater part of their
extent, did indeed pass from the patriarch to the
Evangelist. But had the Evangelist ever such a settled
possession of the city itself as to make it likely that
columns should be set up at Aquileia as well as at
Udine? The treaty which confirmed Venice in the
possession of the patriarchal state left the patriarchal
city to its own bishop and prince. Was the winged
lion ever set up, and then taken down again? The
old map which represents Aquileia in the fifteenth
century shows that, as the pillars carry nothing
now, so they carried nothing then. Again, would
Venetian taste have allowed such clumsy substitutes
for columns as these? And, if they had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
meant as badges of dominion, would they not have
stood in the forum rather than in the court of the
Patriarch's palace?</p>

<p>We are far from having exhausted even the
existing antiquities of Aquileia, further still from
exhausted its long and varied history. Within the
bounds of the fallen city pleasant walks may be
taken, which here and there bring us among memories
of the past. Here is a fine street pavement brought
to light, here a fragment of a theatre. But men do
not dig at Aquileia with the same vigour with which
they dig at Silchester and at Solunto. The difference
between the diggings at the beginning and the end
of a term of six years is less than it should be. But
we have perhaps done enough to point out the claims
of so wonderful a spot on those who look on travelling
as something more than a way either of killing
time or of conforming to fashion. Aquileia has a
character of its own; it is not a ruined or buried
city; nor is it altogether like Trier or Ravenna,
which, though fallen from their ancient greatness, are
cities still. In the general feeling of the spot it
has more in common with such a place as Saint
David's in our own island, that thorough "church
city," where a great minster and its ecclesiastical
establishment still live on amid surrounding desolation.
But there is no reason to believe that Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
David's, as a town, was ever greater than it is now.
Still Saint David's keeps its bishopric, it keeps its
chapter; at Aquileia the patriarch with his fifty
canons are altogether things of the past. We must
seek for their surviving fragments at Udine and
Gorizia. Aquileia then, as regards its present state,
has really fallen lower than Saint David's. But
then at Aquileia we see at every step, what could
never at any time have been seen at Saint David's,
the signs of the days when it ranked among the
great cities of the earth. Aquileia, in short, is
unique. We turn away from it with the feeling that
we have seen one of the most remarkable spots that
Europe can show us. It may be that our horses, excellent
or otherwise, take us back to Monfalcone,
and that from Monfalcone the train takes us back
to Trieste. In theory, it must be remembered, we
have not been at Trieste at all; we are going
thither from Venice, by way of Treviso, Udine,
Gorizia, and Aquileia. In going thither, we shall
outstrip the strict boundary of the Lombard Austria,
though we shall keep within the Italy of Augustus
and the Italy of Charles the Great. On the other
hand, in matter of fact it may be that, as we have
come by the older mode of going from Trieste to
Aquileia, we go on to make our way by the same mode
from Aquileia to Gorizia. In favourable states of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
astronomical world, we may even be lighted on our
way by a newly-risen comet. We follow the precedent
of our forefathers: "Isti mirant stellam." Such
a phænomenon must, according to all ancient belief,
imply the coming of some great shaking among the
powers of the world. In such a frame of mind, the
gazer may be excused if he dreams that the portent
may be sent to show that the boundary which parts
Aquileia and Gorizia from Udine and Treviso need
not be eternal.</p>

<h3>TRIESTE.</h3>
<p>

<h4>1875&mdash;1877&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We have already learned, at Gorizia and at Aquileia,
that, whether in real travel or on the map, the subject
lands of Venice cannot be kept apart from those
neighbour lands which were not her subjects. The
Queen of the Hadriatic could at no time boast of the
possession of the whole Hadriatic coast; could she now
be called up again to her old life, to her old dominion,
she would feel very sensibly that she had only a divided
rule over her own sea. She would find her peer
in a city, a haven, all claim to dominion over which
she had formally resigned more than four hundred
years before her fall. Facing her from the other side
of her own watery kingdom, she would see a city too
far off to be an eyesore, but quite near enough to be
a rival. She is fronted by a city which hardly comes
within the old Venetian land, though it comes within
the bounds of the old Italian kingdom, a city which
for five hundred years has been parted from Venetian
or Italian rule, emphatically a city of the present,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
which has swallowed up no small share of the wealth
and prosperity of the city of the past.</p>

<p><i>Tergeste</i>, Trieste, stands forth as a rival of Venice,
which has, in a low practical view of things, outstripped
her. Italian zeal naturally cries for the recovery of
a great city, once part of the old Italian kingdom,
and whose speech is largely, perhaps chiefly, Italian
to this day. But, cry of <i>Italia Irredenta</i>, however
far it may go, he must not go so far as this. Trieste,
a cosmopolitan city on a Slavonic shore, cannot be
called Italian in the same sense as the lands and
towns so near Verona which yearn to be as Verona
is. Let Trieste be the rival, even the eyesore, of
Venice, still Southern Germany must have a mouth.
We might indeed be better pleased to see Trieste a
free city, the southern fellow of Lübeck, Bremen, and
Hamburg; but it must not be forgotten that the
Archduke of Austria and Lord of Trieste reigns at
Trieste by a far better right than that by which he
reigns at Cattaro and Spizza. The present people of
Trieste did not choose him, but the people of Trieste
five hundred years back did choose the forefather of
his great-grandmother. Compared with the grounds
on which kingdoms, duchies, counties, and lordships,
are commonly held in that neighbourhood, such a
claim as this must be allowed to be respectable indeed.</p>

<p>The great haven of Trieste may almost at pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
be quoted as either confirming or contradicting the
rule that it is not in the great commercial cities of
Europe that we are to look for the choicest or the
most plentiful remains of antiquity. Sometimes the
cities themselves are of modern foundation; in other
cases the cities themselves, as habitations of men and
seats of commerce, are of the hoariest antiquity, but
the remains of their early days have perished through
their very prosperity. Massalia, with her long history,
with her double wreath of freedom, the city which
withstood Cæsar and which withstood Charles of
Anjou, is bare of monuments of her early days. She
has been the victim of her abiding good fortune. We
can look down from the height on the Phôkaian
harbour; but for actual memorials of the men who
fled from the Persian, of the men who defied the
Roman and the Angevin, we might look as well at
Liverpool or at Havre. Genoa, Venice herself, are
hardly real exceptions; they were indeed commercial
cities, but they were ruling cities also, and, as ruling
cities, they reared monuments which could hardly
pass away. What are we to say to the modern rival
of Venice, the upstart rebel, one is tempted to say,
against the supremacy of the Hadriatic Queen?
Trieste, at the head of her gulf, with the hills looking
down to her haven, with the snowy mountains which
seem to guard the approach from the other side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
her inland sea, with her harbour full of the ships of
every nation, her streets echoing with every tongue,
is she to be reckoned as an example of the rule or
an exception to it?</p>

<p>No city at first sight seems more thoroughly modern;
old town and new, wide streets and narrow, we search
them in vain for any of those vestiges of past times
which in some cities meet us at every step. Compare
Trieste with Ancona; we miss the arch of Trajan on
the haven; we miss the cupola of Saint Cyriacus
soaring in triumph above the triumphal monument
of the heathen. We pass through the stately streets
of the newer town, we thread the steep ascents which
lead us to the older town above, and we nowhere
light on any of those little scraps of ornamental architecture,
a window, a doorway, a column, which meet us
at every step in so many of the cities of Italy. Yet
the monumental wealth of Trieste is all but equal
to the monumental wealth of Ancona. At Ancona
we have the cathedral church and the triumphal
arch; so we have at Trieste; though at Trieste we
have nothing to set against the grand front of the
lower and smaller church of Ancona. But at Ancona
arch and <i>duomo</i> both stand out before all eyes; at
Trieste both have to be looked for. The church of
Saint Justus at Trieste crowns the hill as well as the
church of Saint Cyriacus at Ancona; but it does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
in the same way proclaim its presence. The castle,
with its ugly modern fortifications, rises again above
the church; and the <i>duomo</i> of Trieste, with its shapeless
outline and its low, heavy, unsightly campanile, does
not catch the eyes like the Greek cross and cupola
of Ancona. Again at Trieste the arch could never,
in its best days, have been a rival to the arch at
Ancona; and now either we have to hunt it out by
an effort, or else it comes upon us suddenly, standing,
as it does, at the head of a mean street on the ascent
to the upper town. Of a truth it cannot compete
with Ancona or with Rimini, with Orange or with
Aosta. But the <i>duomo</i>, utterly unsightly as it is in
a general view, puts on quite a new character when
we first see the remains of pagan times imprisoned in
the lower stage of the heavy campanile, still more so
when we take our first glance of its wonderful interior.
At the first glimpse we see that here there is a mystery
to be unravelled; and as we gradually find the clue to
the marvellous changes which it has undergone, we
feel that outside show is not everything, and that,
in point both of antiquity and of interest, though not
of actual beauty, the double basilica of Trieste may
claim no mean place among buildings of its own type.
Even after the glories of Rome and Ravenna, the Tergestine
church may be studied with no small pleasure
and profit, as an example of a kind of transformation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of which neither Rome nor Ravenna can supply
another example.</p>

<p class="p2">Whatever was the first origin of Tergeste, whoever,
among the varied and perplexing inhabitants of this
corner of the Hadriatic coast, were the first to pitch
on the spot for a dwelling-place of man, it is plain
that it ranks among the cities which have grown up
out of hill-forts. Trieste in this affords a marked
contrast to Marseilles, as it supplies a marked analogy
to Cumæ and Ancona. The site of the Phôkaian
settlement marks a distinct advance in civilization.
The <i>castellieri</i>, the primitive forts, in the neighbouring
land of Istria, were, according to Captain Burton,
often made into places of Roman occupation, and
something of the same kind may have been the case
with Tergeste itself. The position of the cathedral
church, occupying the site of the capitol of the Roman
colony, shows of itself that Tergeste was thoroughly
a hill-city. It has spread itself downwards, like so
many others, though this time, not into the plain,
but towards the sea. Standing on the border-land of
Italy and Illyria, its destiny has been in some things
the same as that of its neighbours, in others peculiar
to itself. It must not be forgotten that, setting aside
the coast cities, the land in which Trieste stands has
for ages been a Slavonic land, except so far as it is
also partly a Rouman land. How far the Italian and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the Rouman elements may have been originally the
same, is a puzzling question on which it would be
dangerous to enter here. But one thing is certain,
that, if the present inhabitants of the Tergestine city
had obeyed the call of Garibaldi, "Men of Trieste, to
your mountains," they would have found Slavonic
possessors claiming those mountains by the strongest
of all titles. For we have now distinctly passed the
national border. We have come to the lands where
the body is Slavonic, where the Italian element,
greater or smaller, is at most only a fringe along the
coast. Tergeste with the neighbouring lands formed
part of the dominion of Theodoric and of the recovered
Empire of Justinian; but it never came under the
rule of the Lombard. Its allegiance to the lords of
Constantinople and Ravenna, lords whose abiding
power in this region is shown in the foundation of
the Istrian Justinopolis, lasted unshaken till the
Frank conquest, when Tergeste became part of the
Italian kingdom of the Karlings. From that time
to the fourteenth century, its history is the common
history of an Italian city. It is sometimes a free
commonwealth, sometimes subject to, or claimed by,
the Patriarch of Aquileia or to the Serene Republic
itself. By the treaty of Turin in 1381, the independence
of the commonwealth of Trieste was formally
acknowledged by all the contending powers. The
next year the liberated city took the seemingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
strange step of submitting itself to the lordship of
a foreign prince. Leopold, Duke of Austria, he who
died at Sempach, he to whom Venice resigned Treviso,
was received by a solemn act as Lord of Trieste, and
that lordship passed on to the Dukes, Archdukes,
Kings, and Emperors of his house, and from them to
their Lotharingian successors. Thus, unlike Treviso
and Udine, Trieste has been Austrian in one sense
only. Never forming a part of the Austria of Lombardy,
it has had a far more abiding connexion with
the Austria of Germany. The lordship which Trieste
acknowledged was of course at first only an overlordship,
and the Council and Commons of the city
still continued to act as a separate commonwealth.
But an union of this kind is one of those fatal partnerships
between the stronger and the weaker which
can lead only to bondage. Trieste has ever since
remained Austrian in allegiance, save during the
chaos of the days of the elder Buonaparte. Those
days are commemorated by an inscription on the
<i>duomo</i>, which tells of the expulsion of the French from
the castle by an allied force, whose name of "Austro-Angli"
might almost suggest some unrecorded tribe
in our own island.</p>

<p class="p2">It is certainly hard to conceive a building more
uninviting without than the cathedral church of Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Justus. But Sokratês was not to be judged by his
outside, neither is the <i>duomo</i> of Trieste. A broad
and almost shapeless west front is flanked by a low,
heavy tower, not standing detached as a campanile,
as it should stand in Italy, not worked into the church
as it would be worked in England or Germany, but
standing forward in a kind of Scotch fashion, like
Dunkeld. The only architectural feature seems to be
a large wheel window, which it would be unfair to
compare to that of Saint Zeno. But the next moment
will show, built in at the angle of the church and the
tower, a noble fluted column with its half-defaced
Corinthian capital, which is enough to show what has
been. We are carried back to Rome, to Saint Mary
<i>in Cosmedin</i> and Saint Nicolas <i>in Carcere</i>, as we trace
out in the lower stage of the tower the remains of
the temple of Jupiter which has given way to the
church of Justus. Imbedded in its walls are pilasters,
columns, and their basement, showing that Jupiter
of Tergeste must have lifted his pillared portico
above the sea as proudly as Aphroditê of the Doric
Ankón. Fragments of entablatures, trophies, sepulchral
monuments, are built up in the wall. The
western doorway of the church is made out of a huge
tomb of the Barbii&mdash;a <i>gens</i> which we do not elsewhere
remember&mdash;deliberately cut in two, and set up the
wrong way. The building or rebuilding of the tower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
in 1337 is commemorated by an inscription in letters
of that date&mdash;"Gothic" letters, as some call them&mdash;out
of a mutilated part of which the earlier Tergestine
antiquaries spelled out that the tower was rebuilt, in
556, after a destruction by the Goths. As the letters
..LVM.. were enough to create the new saint Philumena,
the letters ..OT... could easily be filled up into
"a Gothis eversa"&mdash;quite evidence enough to lead
a zealous Italian to lay the destroying deeds of his
own forefathers on the Gothic preservers of the works
of the elder day.</p>

<p>As soon as we pass the doorway with the heads of
the Barbii on either side, we forget the wrongs alike
of Jupiter and of the Goths. The wonderful interior
of the double basilica opens upon us. The first feeling
is simply puzzledom. A nave of vast width seems
to be flanked by two ranges of columns on either
side, columns varying even more than is usual in
their height and in the width of the arches which
they support. When we look within the two lateral
ranges, we are not surprised to find each ending in
an apse with a noble mosaic; we are surprised to
find the southern range interrupted by a cupola. This
last phænomenon will help us to the explanation of
the whole mystery. The church is in fact two churches
thrown into one. When they were distinct, they must
have stood even nearer than the old and new minsters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
at Winchester; indeed a plan in a local work shows,
with every probability, their walls as actually touching
in one point. The northern church was a basilica of
the ordinary type, made up of columns&mdash;some of them
of very fine marble&mdash;put together, as usual, without
much regard to uniformity. All bear Corinthian
capitals of different varieties, and all carry the Ravenna
stilt in a rude form without the cross. The wall rose
high above the arcade, and was pierced with a range
of narrow clerestory windows, but with nothing else
to relieve its blankness. This church the Tergestine
antiquaries attribute, but, as far as we can see, without
any direct evidence, to the reign of Theodosius. The
southern church is, in its original parts, the same
in style as the northern, but it is much smaller and,
in its plan at least, thoroughly Byzantine. It was a
small cross church, with a central cupola, and its north
transept seems to have touched the south aisle of its
northern neighbour. It is perhaps on the strength
of the plan that the church is assigned to the reign
of Justinian. But there is nothing Byzantine in the
details; where the original capitals remain, they are
of the same somewhat rude Corinthian character as
those in the northern church; they have the same
stilt, and under the cupola there is even a bit or two
of entablature built up again. But the building went
through much greater changes than the northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
church did in the work of throwing the two into one
whole. The date of this change seems to be fixed
by a consecration recorded in the local annals in 1262.
The south aisle of the northern church, the north
aisle and north transept of the southern one, were
pulled down, and the space which they had covered
was roofed in to form the nave of the united building,
while the two earlier basilicas sank into the position
of its aisles. In the northern church this involved no
change beyond the disappearance of the south aisle
and the blocking of its clerestory; the smaller church
to the south had to suffer far more. It had to be
raised and lengthened; a quadrangular pier on the
south side marks the original length, and the increase
of height of course destroys the proper effect of the
cupola. Then, as the cupola of course rested on
columns with wider arches, its northern arch was filled
up with two smaller arches and an inserted column,
so as to make something like a continuous range.
Still, late in the thirteenth century, they again used
up the old marble columns; but they now used a
flat capital, by which the additions of this time may
be distinguished from the genuine basilican work.</p>

<p>Probably no church anywhere has undergone a
more singular change than this. It is puzzling
indeed at first sight; but, when the key is once
caught, the signs of each alteration are so easily seen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
The other ancient relic at Trieste is the small
triumphal arch. On one side it keeps its Corinthian
pilasters; on the other they are imbedded in a house.
The arch is in a certain sense double; but the
two are close together and touch in the keystone.
The Roman date of this arch cannot be doubted;
but legends connect it both with Charles the Great
and with Richard of Poitou and of England, a prince
about whom Tergestine fancy has been very busy.
The popular name of the arch is <i>Arco Riccardo</i>.</p>

<p>Such, beside some fragments in the museum, are
all the remains that the antiquary will find in
Trieste; not much in point of number, but, in the
case of the <i>duomo</i> at least, of surpassing interest in
their own way. But the true merit of Trieste is not in
anything that it has in itself, its church, its arch, its
noble site. Placed there at the head of the gulf, on
the borders of two great portions of the Empire, it
leads to the land which produced that line of famous
Illyrian Emperors who for a while checked the advance
of our own race in the world's history, and it
leads specially to the chosen home of the greatest
among them. The chief glory of Trieste, after all, is
that it is the way to Spalato.

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Given such weather as suits fair-weather sailors, there
can hardly be any enjoyment more thoroughly unmixed
than a sail along the coast of Dalmatia. First
of all, there is a freshness about everything. Here
is a portion of land which is thoroughly unhackneyed;
the coasts, the islands, the channels, of Dalmatia are
as yet uninvaded by the British tourist. No Cook's
ticket can be taken for Spalato; no hotel coupon
would be of the slightest use at Sebenico. The land
is whatever its long and strange history, old and new,
has made it. It has gone through many changes
and it has put on many shapes, but it has escaped
the fate of being changed into a "playground of
Europe."</p>

<p>The narrow strip of land on the eastern side of
the Hadriatic on which the name of Dalmatia has
settled down has a history which is strikingly analogous
to its scenery. A coast for the most part barren
and rocky, but with its barrenness and rockiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
diversified by a series of noble havens, is fenced off
by a range of mountains from a boundless inland
region. Each of these havens, with the cities which
from early days have sprung up on each, has always
been an isolated centre of civilization in a backward
land. As a rule, broken only during a few centuries
of the universal sway of Rome, the coast and the
inland country have been the possession, by no means
always of different nations, but most commonly of
different governments. On the coast the rule of the
Venetian has been succeeded by the rule of the
Austrian, while in the inland region the rule of native
Slavonic princes has been succeeded by the rule of
the Turk. Yet the Slave, though an earlier settler
than the Turk or the Venetian, was himself only a
settler in comparatively recent times. Native Illyrians,
Greek colonists, Roman colonists, the rule of
the Goth from Ravenna, the rule of the Eastern
Roman from Constantinople, had all to take their
turn before the land put on its present character
of a more or less Italianized fringe on a Slavonic
body, of a narrow rim of Christendom hemming in
the north-eastern conquests of the once advancing and
now receding Mussulman.</p>

<p>So it is with Dalmatian history. As the cultivation
and civilization of the land lies in patches, as harbours
and cities alternate with barren hills, so Dalmatia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
has played a part in history only by fits and starts.
This fitful kind of history goes on from the days
of Greek colonies and Illyrian piracy to the last war
between Italy and Austria. But of continuous history,
steadily influencing the course of the world's progress,
Dalmatia has none to show. Salona plays its part in
the wars both of Cæsar and of Belisarius; Zara reminds
us of the fourth crusade; the whole history of Ragusa
claims a high place among the histories of independent
and isolated cities; Lissa recalls the memory of two
times of warfare within our own century. But if there
was any time when Dalmatia really influenced the
history of the world, it was when Dalmatia had no
national being, when it was merely a province of an
universal dominion along with Britain and Egypt. Of
the great Emperors of the third century, who called
the Roman power into new life and checked the ever-advancing
wave of Teutonic invasion, many came from
the Illyrian lands, several came from the actual
Dalmatian coast. And the most famous among them&mdash;Docles,
Diocletian, Jovius&mdash;not only came forth from
Dalmatia to rule the world, but went back to Dalmatia
to seek rest when weary of the toil of ruling it.</p>

<p>But in our immediate point of view we must never
forget that our course now lies wholly, not only by
subject lands of Venice, but by lands where Venice
appears in her highest character as the bulwark of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Christendom against the misbeliever. The shores and
cities by which we pass, were subject to the Serene
Republic, but subjection to the Serene Republic was
their only chance of escaping subjection to the Ottoman
Sultan. Every town, every fortress, almost every
point of ground along this whole coast, has been
fought for, most of them have been won and lost, over
and over again, in the long crusade which Venice
waged, if for herself, yet for Europe also. Her rule was
an alien rule, but it was still European and Christian;
it shut out the rule of the barbarian. It was a rule
better and worse in different times and places, but it
had always the merit of shutting out a worse rule than
itself, which was ever ready to take its place. Whenever
we see the winged lion keeping guard, the thought
should rise that he kept guard over spots which he
alone kept for Christendom, which he alone saved from
barbarian bondage.</p>

<p class="p2">The visitor to Dalmatia may be conceived as
setting forth from the harbour of Trieste&mdash;from
Trieste with its houses climbing up to the church and
castle on the hill, with the background of mountains
growing in the far distance into snowy Alps. From
the Dalmatian coast itself no snowy Alps are seen;
but the whole land is only a mountain slope, and
the cities are cities on a smaller scale than Trieste,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
and which seldom run so high as Trieste does up the
hill-side. But we must not forget that, even at
Trieste, Dalmatia is still a distant land. There is the
Istrian peninsula to be skirted, the peninsula whose
coast was so long counted among the subject lands
of Venice, while the inland region, under the rule of
counts of Gorizia and dukes of Austria, counted only
among the neighbours of the Republic. The Istrian
coast, largely flat, is marked here and there by
small towns standing well on high points over the
sea, or seen more faintly in the more distant inland
region. But we know that inland Istria is a hilly
land, and, even from the sea, the mountain wall may
still be seen skirting the horizon. Darkness has come
on by the time we reach the harbour of Pola, once
Pietas Julia, now the chief station of the infant navy
of Austria. But the darkness is not so great but that
the dim outline of the vast amphitheatre can be seen,
and the arrangements of the Austrian Lloyd's steamers
allow time enough to go on shore and take in the
general effect both of the amphitheatre and the other
buildings of Pola. We here get our first impression
of the Venetian towns beyond the Hadriatic, all of
which seem to attempt in some sort to reproduce their
mistress, so far as Venice can be reproduced where
there are no canals and therefore no gondolas. But
all have the same narrow, paved streets, the same little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
squares, and, if the passage of horses and wheels is not
so utterly unknown as it is at Venice, their presence
is, to say the least, rare. The lion of Saint Mark is
to be seen everywhere else; by daylight therefore
he is to be seen at Pola also. But the Lloyd's
arrangements condemn Pola, in the early part of
October at least, to be seen only by dim glimpses,
while Zara has an ample measure of daylight. Let no
one however blame a time-table which will bring him
into Spalato with the setting sun, and will allow him
to take his first glance of Diocletian's palace by the
rising moon.</p>

<p>In the night we pass by several islands, but none
are of any historic importance. Veglia lies out of our
path, or we might muse on the evil deeds of the last
independent Count, at least as they were reported by
his Venetian enemies, who were eager to get possession
of his island. The tale will be found in Sir Gardner
Wilkinson's "Dalmatia and Montenegro," a book
which no traveller in these lands should be without.
The next morning's light shows us genuine Dalmatia,
its coast at this stage marked by the barren hills
coming down to the sea and the range of higher
mountains further inland. We skirt among endless
islands, most of which seem barren and uninhabited;
we pass along the channel of Zara, and come to
anchor off the city itself, standing on its peninsula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
crowned with its walls&mdash;Venetian and later&mdash;and with
the towers of its churches rising above them. Here
a stay of several hours allows a pretty full examination
of our first Dalmatian city&mdash;a city however more
Italian and far less thoroughly Dalmatian than other
cities to which our further course will lead us. There
is time to visit the <i>duomo</i> and the smaller churches&mdash;to
mark the two surviving Roman columns&mdash;to thread
the narrow streets, with their occasional scraps of
Venetian architecture&mdash;to stroll by the harbour, under
the gateways marked by the lion of Saint Mark, one
of which so oddly proves to be really a Roman gate
with a Venetian casing. We may even, if we so
think good, climb the mound which, though crowned
by a not attractive Chinese pagoda, nevertheless supplies
the best view of Zara and her two seas. The
<i>Albergo al Cappello</i>&mdash;the sign of the Hat&mdash;supplies
food certainly not worse than an Italian town of the
same class would set before a passing traveller. The
meal done, to sit out of doors in a <i>café</i> is nothing
new to any one who has crossed the straits, not of
Zara but of Calais; but it is a new feeling to do
so in the narrow streets of a Dalmatian town, and to
add the further luxury of maraschino drunk in its
native land.</p>

<p>Night is now passed on board, and Zara is left by
sunrise. Islands and hills again succeed on either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
side, till we enter a narrow strait and find ourselves
in a noble harbour with a town in front, lying, like
most Dalmatian towns except Zara, at the foot of the
mountains. We are in the haven of Sebenico, but the
haven of Sebenico is by no means the whole of the
inlet, which runs much further inland in the shape of
a narrow creek. We land, and give such time as is
allowed us to a sight of the little hill-side city. Shall
we give Sebenico the last place among the cities
which we stay and examine in detail, or the first place
among the lesser cities to which we give such time
as we can in passing by? We are driven to this last
course, not forgetting, if we are minded to turn away
from history and art to look for a while on a striking
natural object, that it is from Sebenico that we may
best make our way to the great waterfall of Kerka.
And, as far as those who have made no special study of
Alpine matters may speak, the falls of Kerka, rushing
down in a company of torrents side by side, look as if
they had a right to take a high place among the falls
at least of the old world. But Sebenico is not simply
the way to Kerka; there is something to see in
Sebenico itself. It is a hill city, but it is emphatically
not a hill-top city, but a hill-side city. We climb
up through the inhabited town to the castle, and when
we reach the castle, we are far from having reached
the hill top. And to those who make Sebenico their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
second halting-place on the strictly Dalmatian coast
it will have a special interest. Much smaller than
Zara, it is far more thoroughly Dalmatian; costume
is more marked, and its position gives it that peculiar
air of quaintness which is shared by all places where
narrow streets run up a steep hill. And those streets
moreover are rich with architectural features, graceful
windows and the like, which witness to the influence
of the ruling city. And there is something not a
little taking in the small <i>piazza</i> of Sebenico&mdash;the
arcaded <i>loggia</i> on the one side, the cathedral on the
other, with its mixed but stately architecture, its
waggon-roof of stone standing out boldly without
either buttress or external roof. Mr. Neale, whom, as
he does not rule Sebenico to be a "church city," we
may now quote seriously, holds that the cathedral of
Sebenico is "in an exclusively architectural view the
most interesting church in Dalmatia." He adds that
"in truth it is one of the noblest, most striking, most
simple, most Christian of churches." This is high
praise, especially when bestowed by Mr. Neale on a
church which was consecrated so lately as 1555. But
there is no denying that, strangely confused as is its
style, the church of Sebenico is, both inside and out,
not only a most remarkable, but a thoroughly effective
building. The internal proportions are noble; the
height is great; the columns, though their arches are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
pointed, might have stood in any basilica at Rome
or Ravenna; the barrel vaulting carries us away to
Saint Sernin at Toulouse and to the Conqueror's
Tower. The details are a strange mixture of late
Gothic and <i>Renaissance</i>, very rich and somehow very
effective. It is not exactly like that class of French
churches of which Saint Eustache at Paris is the
grandest example, where a thoroughly mediæval outline
is carried out with <i>Renaissance</i> detail. At Sebenico
we see side by side, a bit in one style and a bit in
the other, and yet the two contrive to harmonize.
We go down again to the haven; we mark a few
classical capitals preserved, as we here preserve ammonites
and pieces of rock-work; we start again to make
the second portion of our second day's voyage, and to
reach the most marked and memorable spot in our
whole course.</p>

<p>After Sebenico the coast is for a while almost free
from islands. Presently we pass along among a few
small ones, and Lissa, famous for piracies two thousand
years back and for more regular warfare in our own
century and in our own day, shows itself in the distance.
Our course has by this time turned nearly
due east. We pass by Bua, hardly conscious that it
is an island. We pass by the mouth of the bay
which Bua guards, hardly conscious of the depth of
the inlet into which it leads, or that two cities&mdash;Traü
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and fallen Salona&mdash;are washed by its waters. For the
child of Salona, the great object of a Dalmatian voyage,
is coming within sight far away. The mighty
campanile of Spalato rises, kindled with the last rays
of sunlight; presently the cupola of the metropolitan
church, the long line of the palace wall, the buildings
of what is plainly no inconsiderable city, stand out
against their mountain background. The sun has
gone down behind the western headland, but we can
get our first glimpse of the city, its arcades and
tower and temples, by that moonlight which is as
good at Spalato as at Melrose. We have been in
the home of Diocletian, and we go back to our ship,
for the next day to bring us to the one city along
these shores which the might of Venice could never
bring into subjection.</p>

<p class="p2">In such a voyage as this many points necessarily
escape notice, and the great objects of study are well
reserved for the return journey. In all travelling for
instruction's sake, it is a point specially to be insisted
on that every place should, whenever it is possible,
be seen twice. Nothing fixes a thing so well in the
memory as going through the process of recollection.
And, in such a voyage as this, it is no bad way to go
at once to the furthest point, to see on the way so
much of the several points as the arrangements of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
steamers allow, and to stop a longer time at the
important places coming back. In this way a general
notion of Dalmatia and its cities is gained first of
all&mdash;a notion which may be enlarged and corrected by
more minute examination of the chief places, and
of course, foremost among them, of Spalato itself. But
Spalato, though the great object of a Dalmatian voyage,
is by no means its final object. When we have
reached Spalato, we have not yet gone through half
our course. Before we can come back to study its
wonders more worthily, we have to spend a day in
the archipelago of larger islands, nearly each of which,
unlike their northern fellows, has some old historical
memory. We have for part of another day to sail
along that still narrower strip of Christendom which
fences off Ragusa from the Mussulman, to thread our
way through the lovely Bocche of Cattaro, till we
reach the furthest of Dalmatian cities, with the path
to unconquered Montenegro over our heads.</p>

<h3>PARENZO.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>
<h4>1875.</h4>
<hr class="l15" />

<p>Parenzo, the ancient colony of Parentium, is likely
to be, for many travellers in Istria and Dalmatia, their
first point of stoppage after leaving Trieste. To such
travellers it will be the beginning of the dominion of
Venice in spots lying wholly beyond the Hadriatic,
the first glimpse of the long series of lands and cities,
from Istria to Cyprus, which once "looked to the
winged lion's marble piles," and where the winged
lion still abides in stone to keep up the memory of
his old dominion. The short voyage is a lovely one.
Looking back, there is Trieste on her hill-side, with
her suburbs and detached houses spreading far away
in both directions, and backed by the vast semicircle
of the Julian Alps, with the snowy peaks of their
higher summits soaring above all. The northern part
of the Istrian peninsula, as we see it from the sea, has
a strikingly rich and picturesque look, which is lost as
we follow the coast towards the south. The small
Istrian towns, each one of which has its civil and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
ecclesiastical history, jut out, each one on its own
smaller peninsula; and in this part of the voyage the
spaces between them are not lacking in signs of
human dwelling and cultivation. Capo d'Istria, once
Justinopolis, lies in its gulf to the left, to remind us
that we have passed into the dominions of the Cæsars
of the East. Forwards, Pirano stands on its headland,
its <i>duomo</i> rising above the water on arcades built up
to save it from the further effects of the stripping
process which is so clearly seen along the coast. The
castle, with its many towers capped with their Scala
battlements, rises over town and church, with a picturesqueness
not common in Italian buildings. The
church, on the other hand, is as far from picturesque
as most Italian churches are without, and the detached
campanile is simply, like many other Istrian bell-towers,
a miniature of the great tower of the ruling
city. But neither Capo d'Istria nor Pirano is so
likely to cause the traveller bound for Dalmatia to
halt as the other and more famous peninsular town
of Parenzo. Long before Parenzo is reached, the
Istrian shore has lost its beauty, though the Istrian
hills, now and then capped by a hill-side town, and
the higher mountains beyond them, tell us something
of the character of the inland scenery. At last the
Parentine headland is reached; the temples which
crowned it are no longer to be seen, but the campanile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
of the famous <i>duomo</i>, with its Veronese spire, and
one or two smaller towers, have taken their place as
the prominent objects of the little city. On the side
which would otherwise be open to the Hadriatic, the
isle of Saint Nicolas shuts in the haven guarded by a
round Venetian tower. The other side of the peninsula
is washed by the mouth&mdash;here we must not say
the estuary&mdash;of a stream yellow as Tiber, which comes
rushing down by a small waterfall from the high
ground where the Parentine peninsula joins the mainland.
On this peninsula stood the older <i>municipium</i>
of Parentium, and the colony, some say the Julian
Colony of Augustus, others the Ulpian Colony of
Trajan. The zeal of Dr. Kandler, the great master of
Istrian antiquities, made out the position of the forum,
patrician and plebeian, of the capitol, the theatre, and
the temples. The traveller will probably need a
guide even to the temples, though one of them keeps
the greater part of its stylobate, and the other one
has two broken fluted columns left. A single inscribed
stone in the ancient forum he can hardly fail to see;
but the truth is that the Roman remains of Parentium
are such as concern only immediate inquirers into
local Parentine history. At Pola it is otherwise; there
the Roman remains stand out as the great object,
utterly overshadowing the buildings of later times;
but at Parenzo the main interest, as it is not mediæval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
so neither is it pagan Roman. As at Ravenna, so at
Parenzo, the real charm is to be found in the traces
which it keeps of the great transitional ages when
Roman and Teuton stood side by side. Against the
many objects of Ravenna Parenzo has only to set its
one. It has no palace, no kingly tomb&mdash;though the
thought cannot fail to suggest itself that it was from
Istrian soil that the mighty stone was brought which
once covered the resting-place of Theodoric. Parenzo
has but a single church of moment, but that church
is one which would hold no mean place even among
the glories of Ravenna. The capitol of Parentium
has given way to the episcopal precinct, and the
temple of the capitoline god has given way to the
great basilica of Saint Maurus, the building which
now gives Parenzo its chief claim to the study of
those for whom the days of the struggle of Goth
and Roman have a special charm.</p>

<p class="p2">As to the date of the church of Parenzo there seems
little doubt. It is a basilica of the reign of Justinian,
which has been preserved with remarkably little
change, and which will hardly find, out of Rome and
Ravenna, any building of its own class to surpass it.
With the buildings of Ravenna it stands in immediate
connexion, being actually contemporary with the work
both at Saint Vital and at Saint Apollinaris in Classe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Its foundation is a little later, as the church of
Parenzo seems to have been begun after the reconquest
of Italy and Istria by Belisarius, while both
Saint Vital and Saint Apollinaris, though finished
under the rule of the Emperor, were begun under the
rule of the Goth. There are points at Parenzo which
connect it with both the contemporary churches of
Ravenna. The pure basilican form, the shape of the
apse, hexagonal without, though round within, are
common to Parenzo and Classis; the capitals too have
throughout the Ravenna stilt above them; but of the
capitals themselves many take that specially Byzantine
shape which at Ravenna is found only in Saint Vital.
That the founder was a Bishop Euphrasius is shown
by his monogram on many of the stilts, by the great
mosaic of the apse, in which he appears holding the
church in his hand as founder, and by the inscription
on the disused tabernacle, which is engraved in Mr.
Neale's book on Dalmatia and Istria. At Parenzo, as
at Sebenico, Mr. Neale was in a serious mood; but,
though he copied the inscription rightly or nearly so,
he misunderstood it in the strangest fashion, and
thereby led himself into much needless puzzledom.
Euphrasius, according to Dr. Kandler, having been
before a decurion of the town, became the first bishop
in 524, when the Istrian bishoprics were founded
under Theodoric. The church would seem to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
been built between 535 and 543. The inscription runs
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Famul[us] . D[e]i . Eufrasius . Antis[tes] . temporib[us] . suis .
ag[ens] an[num] . xi. hunc. loc[um] . fondamen[tis] . D[e]o . jobant[e] .
s[an]c[t]e . æc[c]l[esie] Catholec[e] . cond[idit].
</p>
</div>

<p>The church was therefore begun in the eleventh year
of the episcopate of Euphrasius; that is, in 535.
Dr. Kandler prints, unluckily only in an Italian
translation, a document of 543, the sixteenth year of
Justinian, who appears with his usual titles, in which
Euphrasius makes regulations for the Chapter, and
speaks of the church as something already in being.
Mr. Neale quotes from Coletti, the editor of Ughelli's
<i>Italia Sacra</i>, part of a document in Latin which is
obviously the same, but which is assigned to 796,
the sixteenth year of Constantine the Sixth. The
difference is strange; but the date of the document
does not directly affect the date of the church, and,
whatever be the date of either, Mr. Neale needlessly
perplexed himself with the inscription. He says that
the inscription commemorates a certain Pope John,
and wonders that Euphrasius, who took part in the
Aquileian schism about the Three Chapters&mdash;the
Three Chapters which readers of Gibbon will remember&mdash;should
record the name of a Pope with
whom he was not in communion. But this difficulty
is got rid of by the simple fact that there is nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
about any Pope John in the inscription. Mr. Neale
strangely read the two words DO . IOBANT .&mdash;the
words are carefully marked off by stops&mdash;that is,
in the barbarous spelling of the inscription, DEO
IVVANTE, into the four words "Domino Johanne
Beatissimo Antistite." We therefore need not, in
fixing the date of the church of Parenzo, trouble
ourselves about any Popes. There can be no doubt
that it is the work of Euphrasius, and that Euphrasius
was one of those who opposed Rome about the Three
Chapters. In any case, the <i>duomo</i> of Parenzo has
the interest which attaches to any church built while
our own forefathers were still worshipping Woden;
and we may safely add that it has the further
interest of being built by a prelate who threw off
all allegiance to the see of Rome.</p>

<p>The church is indeed a noble one, and its long
arcades preserve to us one of the most speaking
examples of the forms of a great basilica. Every
arch deserves careful study, because at Parenzo the
capitals seem not to have been the spoil of earlier
buildings, but to have been made for the church
itself. Some still cleave to the general Corinthian
type, though without any slavish copying of classical
models. Animal forms are freely introduced; bulls,
swans, and other creatures, are made to do duty as
volutes; and when bulls and swans are set on that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
work, we may be sure that the Imperial bird is not
left idle. Others altogether forsake the earlier types;
it perhaps became a church built in the dominions of
Justinian while Saint Sophia was actually rising, that
some of its capitals should adopt the square Byzantine
form enwreathed with its basket-work of foliage. But
all, whatever may be their form in other ways, carry
the Ravenna stilt, marked, in some cases at least, with
the monogram of the founder Euphrasius. Happily
the love of red rags which is so rampant on either
side of Parenzo, at Trieste and at Zara, seems not to
have spread to Parenzo itself, and the whole of this
noble series of capitals may be studied with ease.
The upper part, including the arches, has been more
or less Jesuited within and without, but enough remains
to make out the original arrangements. The
soffits on the north side are ornamented like those in
the basilica of Theodoric, a style of ornament identical
with that of so many Roman roofs; above was a
simple round-headed clerestory, and outside are the
same slight beginnings of ornamental arcades which
are to be seen at Saint Apollinaris in Classe. The
apse, with its happily untouched windows and its
grand mosaic, also carries us across to Ravenna.
Besides the founder Euphrasius, we see the likeness
of the Archdeacon Claudius and his son, a younger
Euphrasius, besides Saint Maurus the patron and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
other saintly personages. Below is a rich ornament,
but which surely must be of somewhat later date,
formed largely of the actual shells of mother-of-pearl.
The Bishop's throne is in its place; and, as at Ravenna
and in the great Roman basilicas, mass is celebrated
by the priest standing behind the altar with his face
westward. Such was doubtless the usage of the days
of Euphrasius, and in such an old-world place as
Parenzo it still goes on.</p>

<p>But if, in this matter, Parenzo clings to a very
ancient use, we may doubt whether, at Parenzo or
anywhere else, the men who made these great apses
and covered them with these splendid mosaics designed
them to be, as they so often are, half hidden by the
<i>baldacchini</i> which cover the high altar. Even in Saint
Ambrose at Milan, where the apse is so high above
the altar and where apse and <i>baldacchino</i> are of the
same date, we feel that the view of the east end is in
some measure interfered with. Much more is this
the case at Parenzo, where the apse is lower and the
<i>baldacchino</i> more lofty. But the Parenzo <i>baldacchino</i>,
dating from 1277, is a noble work of its kind, and it
is wonderful how little change the course of seven
hundred years has made in some of its details as compared
with those of the great arcades. The pointed
arch is used, and the Ravenna stilt is absent; but
the capitals, with their animal volutes, are almost the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
same as some of those of Euphrasius. Between the
date of Euphrasius and the date of the <i>baldacchino</i> we
hear of more than one consecration, one of which, in
961, is said to have followed a destroying Slavonic
inroad; but it is clear that any works done then must
have been works of mere repair, not of rebuilding.
No one can doubt that the columns and their capitals
are the work of Euphrasius, and by diligently peeping
round among the mass of buildings by which the
church is encumbered, the original design may be
seen outside as well as in.</p>

<p>But the church of Parenzo is not merely a basilica;
it has all the further accompaniments of an Italian
episcopal church. West of the church stands the
atrium, with the windows of the west front and the
remains of mosaic enrichment rising above it. An
arcade of three on each side surrounds the court, a
court certainly far smaller than that of Saint Ambrose.
Two columns with Byzantine capitals stand on each
side; the rest are ancient, but those of the west side
are a repair of the present king, or by whatever title
it is that the King of Dalmatia and Lord of Trieste
reigns on the intermediate Istrian shore. To the
west of the atrium is the roofless baptistery, to the
west of that the not remarkable campanile. We
have thus reached the extreme west of this great
pile of building, which, after all&mdash;such is the difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of scale between the churches of northern and
southern Europe&mdash;reaches only the measure of one of
our smallest minsters or greatest parish churches.
The basilica of Parenzo, with all its accompaniments,
measures, according to Mr. Neale's plan, only about
240 feet in length. But, if we have traced out those
accompaniments towards the west, we have not yet
done with those towards the east. A modern quasi-transept
has been thrown out on each side, of which
the northern one strangely forms the usual choir,
much as in St. Peter's at Rome. These additions
have columns with Byzantine capitals, like those in
the atrium, copied from the old ones. But beyond
this choir, and connected with the original church,
is a low vaulted building of the plainest round-arched
work, called, as usual, the "old church," the "pagan
temple," and what not, which leads again into two
chapels, the furthest having an eastern apse. Now
these chapels have a mosaic pavement, and it is
most remarkable that, below the pavement of the
church, is a pavement some feet lower, which evidently
belongs to some earlier building, and which
is on the same level as the pavement of these
chapels. It is therefore quite possible that we have
here some remains of a building, perhaps a church,
earlier than the time of Euphrasius. Between Constantine
and Justinian there was time enough for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
church to be built at Parentium and for Euphrasius
to think it needful to rebuild it. Lastly, among the
canonical buildings on the south side of the church
is one, said to have been a tithe barn, with a grand
range of Romanesque coupled windows, bearing date
1250. They remind us somewhat of the so-called
John of Gaunt's stables, the real Saint Mary's Guild,
at Lincoln. In short, so long as any traces are left
of the style once common to all Western Europe,
England and Italy are ever reminding us of one
another.</p>

<p>Such is the church of Parenzo, and at Parenzo the
church is the main thing. As we pass away, and
catch the last traces of the church of Euphrasius
rising above the little peninsular city, our thoughts
fly back to the other side of the Hadriatic, and it
seems as if the men who came to fetch the great
stone from Istria to Ravenna had left one of the
noblest basilicas of their own city behind them on the
Istrian shore.</p>

<h3>POLA.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>After Parenzo the most obvious stopping-place on
the Istrian shore will be Pola; and at Pola the main
objects of interest for the historical student will be
classed in an order of merit exactly opposite to those
which he has seen at Parenzo. At Parenzo the main
attraction is the great basilica, none the less attractive
as being a monument of early opposition to the claims
of the Roman see. Beside this ecclesiastical treasure
the remains of the Parentine colony are felt to be
quite secondary. At Pola things are the other way;
the monuments of Pietas Julia claim the first place;
the basilica, though not without a certain special
interest, comes long after them. The character of the
place is fixed by the first sight of it; we see the
present and we see the more distant past; the Austrian
navy is to be seen, and the amphitheatre is to be seen.
But intermediate times have little to show; if the
duomo strikes the eye at all, it strikes it only by the
extreme ugliness of its outside, nor is there anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
very taking, nothing like the picturesque castle of
Pirano, in the works which occupy the site of the
colonial capitol. The <i>duomo</i> should not be forgotten;
even the church of Saint Francis is worth a glance;
but it is in the remains of the Roman colony, in the
amphitheatre, the arches, the temples, the fragments
preserved in that temple which serves, as at Nîmes,
for a museum, that the real antiquarian wealth of
Pola lies.</p>

<p>There is no need to go into the mythical history of
the place. Tales about Thracians and Argonauts
need not be seriously discussed at this time of day.
Nor can there be any need to show that the name
Pola is not a contraction of Pietas Julia. Save for
the slight accidental likeness of letters, so to say is
about as reasonable as to say that London is a corruption
of Augusta, or Jerusalem of Ælia. In all
these cases the older, native, familiar, name outlived
the later, foreign, official, name. When we have
thoroughly cleared up the origin of the Illyrians and
the old Veneti, we may know something of the earliest
inhabitants of Pola, and possibly of the origin of its
name. But the known history of Pola begins with
the Roman conquest of Istria in 178 <span class="s05">B.C.</span> The town
became a Roman colony and a flourishing seat of
commerce. Its action on the republican side in the
civil war brought on it the vengeance of the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Cæsar. But the destroyer became the restorer, and
Pietas Julia, in the height of its greatness, far surpassed
the extent either of the elder or the younger
Pola. Like all cities of this region, Pola kept up its
importance down to the days of the Carolingian
Empire, the specially flourishing time of the whole
district being that of Gothic and Byzantine dominion
at Ravenna. A barbarian king, the Roxolan Rasparasanus,
is said to have withdrawn to Pola after the
submission of his nation to Hadrian; and the panegyrists
of the Flavian house rank Pola along with
Trier and Autun among the cities which the princes
of that house had adorned or strengthened. But in
the history of their dynasty the name of the city
chiefly stands out as the chosen place for the execution
of princes whom it was convenient to put out of the
way. Here Crispus died at the bidding of Constantine,
and Gallus at the bidding of Constantius. Under
Theodoric, Pola doubtless shared that general prosperity
of the Istrian land on which Cassiodorus grows
eloquent when writing to its inhabitants. In the next
generation Pola appears in somewhat of the same
character which has come back to it in our own times;
it was there that Belisarius gathered the Imperial fleet
for his second and less prosperous expedition against
the Gothic lords of Italy. But, after the break up
of the Frankish Empire, the history of mediæval Pola
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
is but a history of decline. It was, in the geography
of Dante, the furthest city of Italy; but, like most
of the other cities of its own neighbourhood, its day of
greatness had passed away when Dante sang. Tossed
to and fro between the temporal and spiritual lords
who claimed to be marquesses of Istria, torn by the
dissensions of aristocratic and popular parties among
its own citizens, Pola found rest, the rest of bondage,
in submission to the dominion of Saint Mark in 1331.
Since then, till its new birth in our own times, Pola
has been a falling city. Like the other Istrian and
Dalmatian towns, modern revolutions have handed it
over from Venice to Austria, from Austria to France,
from France to Austria again. It is under its newest
masters that Pola has at last begun to live a fresh
life, and the haven whence Belisarius sailed forth has
again become a haven in more than name, the cradle
of the rising navy of the united Austrian and
Hungarian realm.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="i138" id="i138"></a>
<img src="images/i138.jpg" width="500" height="367" alt="Porta Gemina" />
<p class="caption">PORTA GEMINA, POLA.</p>
</div>

<p>That haven is indeed a noble one. Few sights are
more striking than to see the huge mass of the
amphitheatre at Pola seeming to rise at once out of
the land-locked sea. As Pola is seen now, the amphitheatre
is the one monument of its older days which
strikes the eye in the general view, and which divides
attention with signs that show how heartily the once
forsaken city has entered on its new career. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
in the old time Pola could show all the buildings
which befitted its rank as a colony of Rome. The
amphitheatre of course stood without the walls; the
city itself stood at the foot and on the slope of the
hill which was crowned by the capitol of the colony,
where the modern fortress rises above the Franciscan
church. Parts of the Roman wall still stand; one of
its gates is left; another has left a neighbour and a
memory. At the north side of the capitol stands the
<i>Porta Gemina</i>, leading from it to the amphitheatre.
The outer gateway remains, a double gate-way, as
its name implies, with three Corinthian half-columns
between and on each side of the two arches. But here
steps in a singular architectural peculiarity, one which
reminds us that we are on the road to Spalato, and
which already points to the arcades of Diocletian.
The columns support an entablature with its frieze
and cornice, but the architrave is wanting. Does not
this show a lurking sign of what was coming, a
lurking feeling that the arch itself was the true
architrave? Be this as it may, there it stands,
sinning, like so many other ancient works, against
pedantic rules, but perhaps thereby winning its place
in the great series of architectural strivings which the
palace of Spalato shows us the crowning-point. The
other arch, which is commonly known as <i>Porta Aurea</i>
or <i>Porta Aurata</i>, conforms more nearly to ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
rules. Here we have the arch with the coupled
Corinthian columns on each side of it, supporting, as
usual, their bit of broken entablature, and leaving
room for a spandril filled in much the same fashion
as in the arch of Severus at Rome. Compared with
other arches of the same kind, this arch of Pola may
certainly claim to rank amongst the most graceful
of its class. With Trajan's arch at Ancona it can
hardly be compared. That tallest and slenderest of
monumental arches palpably stands on the haven to
be looked at; while the arch of Pola, like its fellows
at Rimini and Aosta, and like the arch of Drusus
at Rome, is a real thoroughfare, which the citizens
of Pietas Julia must have been in the daily habit
of passing under. And, as compared with the arches
of Rimini and Aosta, its design is perhaps the most
pleasing of the three. Its proportions are better
designed; the coupled columns on each side are more
graceful than either the single columns at Rimini or
the pair of columns which at Aosta are placed so
much further apart. The idolater of minute rules
will not be offended, as at Aosta, with Doric triglyphs
placed over Corinthian capitals, and the lover of
consistent design will not regret the absence of the
sham pediment of Rimini. But it must be borne in
mind that the arch of Pola did not originally stand
alone, and that its usual name of <i>Porta Aurea</i> is a
misnomer. It was built close against the <i>golden gate</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of the city, whose name it has usurped. But it is, in
truth, the family arch of the Sergii, raised in honour of
one of that house by his wife Salvia Postuma. As such,
it has a special interest in the local history of Pola.
Ages afterwards, as late as the thirteenth century,
Sergii appear again at Pola, as one of the chief families
by whose dissensions the commonwealth was torn in
pieces. If there is authentic evidence to connect these
latter Sergii with the Sergii of the arch, and these
again with the great Patrician <i>gens</i> which played such
a part in the history of the Roman commonwealth,
here would indeed be a pedigree before which that
of the house of Paris itself might stand abashed.</p>

<p>A curious dialogue of the year 1600 is printed by
Dr. Kandler in his little book, <i>Cenni al Forrestiere
che visita Pola</i>, which, with a later little book, <i>Pola und
seine nächste Umgebung</i>, by A. Gareis, form together
a very sufficient guide for the visitor to Pola. From
this evidence it is plain that, as late as the end of
the sixteenth century, the ancient buildings of Pola
were in a far more perfect state than they are now.
Even late in the next century, in the days of Spon
and Wheler, a great deal was standing that is no
longer there. Wheler's view represents the city surrounded
with walls, and with at least one gate. The
amphitheatre stands without the wall; the arch of
the Sergii stands within it; but the theatre must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
have utterly vanished, because in the references to
the plan its name is given to the amphitheatre.
And it must have been before this time that the
amphitheatre had begun to be mutilated in order to
supply materials for the fortress on the capitoline
hill. Indeed it is even said that there was at one
time a scheme for carrying off the amphitheatre
bodily to Venice and setting it up on the Lido.
This scheme, never carried out, almost beats one
which actually was carried out, when the people of
Jersey gave a <i>cromlech</i> as a mark of respect to a
popular governor, by whom it was carried off and set
up in his grounds in England. Of the two temples
in the forum, that which is said to have been dedicated
to Diana is utterly masked by the process which
turned it into the palace of the Venetian governor.
A decent Venetian arcade has supplanted its portico;
but some of the original details can be made out on
the other sides. But the temple of Augustus, the
restorer of Pietas Julia, with its portico of unfluted
Corinthian columns, still fittingly remains almost untouched.
Fragments and remains of all dates are
gathered together within and without the temple, and
new stores are constantly brought to light in digging
the foundations for the buildings of the growing town.
But the chief wonder of Pola, after all, is its amphitheatre.
Travellers are sometimes apt to complain,
and that not wholly without reason, that all amphitheatres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
are very like one another. At Pola this
remark is less true than elsewhere, as the amphitheatre
there has several marked peculiarities of its
own. We do not pretend to expound all its details
scientifically; but this we may say, that those who
dispute&mdash;if the dispute still goes on&mdash;about various
points as regards the Coliseum at Rome will do well
to go and look for some further lights in the amphitheatre
of Pola. The outer range, which is wonderfully
perfect, while the inner arrangements are fearfully
ruined, consists, on the side towards the town, of two
rows of arches, with a third story with square-headed
openings above them. But the main peculiarity in
the outside is to be found in four tower-like projections,
not, as at Arles and Nîmes, signs of Saracenic
occupation, but clearly parts of the original design.
Many conjectures have been made about them; they
look as if they were means of approach to the upper
part of the building; but it is wisest not to be
positive. But the main peculiarity of this amphitheatre
is that it lies on the slope of a hill, which
thus supplied a natural basement for the seats on one
side only. But this same position swallowed up the
lower arcade on this side, and it hindered the usual
works underneath the seats from being carried into
this part of the building. In the other part the
traces of the underground arrangements are very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
clear, especially those which seem to have been meant
for the <i>naumachiæ</i>. These we specially recommend
to any disputants about the underground works of
the Flavian amphitheatre.</p>

<p>The Roman antiquities of Pola are thus its chief
attraction, and they are enough to give Pietas Julia a
high place among Roman colonies. But the ecclesiastical
side of the city must not be wholly forgotten.
The <i>duomo</i>, if a small matter after that of Parenzo,
if absolutely unsightly as seen from without, is not
without its importance. It may briefly be described
as a church of the fifteenth century, built on the lines
of an ancient basilica, some parts of whose materials
have been used up again. There is, we believe, no
kind of doubt as to the date, and we do not see why
Mr. Neale should have wondered at Murray's Handbook
for assigning the building to the time to which
it really belongs. No one could surely have placed a
church with pointed arches, and with capitals of the
kind so common in Venetian buildings, more than a
century or two earlier. There is indeed an inscription
built into the south wall which has a special interest
from another point of view, but which, one would
have thought, could hardly have led any one to
mistake the date of the existing church. It records
the building of the church by Bishop Handegis in
857, "Regnante Ludowico Imperatore Augusto in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Italia." The minute accuracy of the phrase&mdash;"the
Emperor Lewis being King in Italy"&mdash;is in itself
something amazing; and this inscription shares the
interest which attaches to any memorial of that gallant
prince, the most truly Roman Emperor of his line.
And it is something to mark that the stonecutter
doubted between "L<i>o</i>dowico" and "L<i>u</i>dowico," and
wrote both letters, one over the other. But the inscription
of course refers to a reconstruction some
hundred years earlier than the time when the church
took its present shape. Yet these basilican churches
were so constantly reconstructed over and over again,
and largely out of the same materials, that the building
of the fifteenth century may very well reproduce the
general effect, both of the building of the eighth and
of the far earlier church, parts of which have lived on
through both recastings.</p>

<p>The ten arches on each side of the Polan basilica
are all pointed, but the width of the arches differs.
Some of them are only just pointed, and it is only in
the most eastern pair of arches that the pointed form
comes out at all prominently. For here the arches
are the narrowest of the series, and the columns the
slightest, that on the south side being banded. The
arch of triumph, which is round, looks very much as
if it had been preserved from the earlier church; and
such is clearly the case with two columns and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
capital, whose classical Corinthian foliage stands in
marked contrast with the Venetian imitations on each
side of it. The church, on the whole, though not
striking after such a marvel as Parenzo, is really one
of high interest, as an example of the way in which
the general effect of an early building was sometimes
reproduced at a very late time. Still at Pola, among
such wealth of earlier remains, it is quite secondary,
and its beauties are, even more than is usual in
churches of its type, altogether confined to the inside.
The campanile is modern and worthless, and the outside
of the church itself is disfigured, after the usual
fashion of Italian ugliness, with stable-windows and
the like. Yet even they are better than the red rags
of Trieste and Zara within.</p>

<p>Such is Pola, another step on the road to the birthplace
of true grace and harmony in the building art.
Yet, among the straits and islands of the Dalmatian
coast, there is more than one spot at which the traveller
bound for Spalato must stop. The first and most
famous one is the city where Venetians and Crusaders
once stopped with such deadly effect on that voyage
which was to have led them to Jerusalem, but which
did lead them only to New Rome. After the glimpses
of Istria taken at Parenzo and Pola, the first glimpse,
not of Dalmatia itself, but of the half-Italian cities
which fringe its coast, may well be taken at Zara.</p>

<h3>ZARA.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1877&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The name of Zara is familiar to every one who has
read the history of the Fourth Crusade, and its fate in
the Fourth Crusade is undoubtedly the one point in
its history which makes Zara stand out prominently
before the eyes of the world. Of all the possessions
of Venice along this coast, it is the one whose connexion
with Venice is stamped for ever on the pages
of universal history. Those who know nothing else
of Zara, who perhaps know nothing at all of the other
cities, at least know that, at the beginning of the
thirteenth century, the possession of Zara was claimed
by Venice, and that the claim of Venice was made
good by the help of warriors of the Cross who thus
turned aside from their course, not for the last time,
to wield their arms against a Christian city. It is as
Zara that the city is famous, because it is as Zara that
its name appears in the pages of the great English
teller of the tale. And perhaps those who may casually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
light on some mention of the city by any of its earlier
names may not at once recognize Zara under the form
either of <i>Jadera</i> or of <i>Diadora</i>. One is curious to
know how a city which under the first Augustus
became a Roman colony by the name of <i>Jadera</i> had,
in the time of his orthodox successors in the tenth
century, changed its name into anything with such a
heathenish sound as <i>Diadora</i>. Yet such was its name
in the days of Constantine Porphyrogenitus; and the
Imperial historian does not make matters much clearer
when he tells us that the true Roman name of the city
was "Jam erat," implying that the city so called was
older than Rome. Let us quote him in his own Greek,
if only to show how oddly his Latin words look in
their Greek dress.</p>

</span></p>

<p>Yet the name of the colony of Augustus lived on
through these strange changes and stranger etymologies,
and even in the narrative of the Crusade it
appears as <i>Jadres</i> in the text of Villehardouin.</p>

<p>The history of the city in the intermediate ages is
the usual history of the towns on the Dalmatian coast.
They all for a while keep on their formal allegiance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
to the Eastern Empire, sometimes being really its
subjects, sometimes being practically independent,
sometimes tributary to the neighbouring Slaves. Still,
under all changes, they clave to the character of
Roman cities, just as they still remain seats of Italian
influence in a Slavonic land. Then came a second
time of confusion, in which Zara and her sister cities
are tossed to and fro between another set of contending
disputants. The Eastern Empire hardly
keeps even a nominal claim to the Dalmatian towns;
the Slavonic settlements have grown into regular kingdoms;
Hungary on one side, Venice on the other, are
claiming the dominion of the Dalmatian coast. The
history of Zara now consists of conquests and reconquests
between the Republic of Saint Mark and
the Hungarian and Croatian kings. The one moment
when Zara stands out in general history is the famous
time when one of the Venetian reconquests was made
by the combined arms of the Republic and the Frank
Crusaders. The tale is a strange episode in a greater
episode&mdash;the episode of the conquest of the New
Rome by the united powers which first tried their
'prentice hand on Zara. But the siege, as described
by the Marshal of Champagne and the many writers
who have followed him, is not easy to understand,
except by those who have either seen the place itself
or have maps before them such as are not easily to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
be had. Like so many other Istrian and Dalmatian
towns, Zara stands on a narrow peninsula, lying east
and west. It has on its north side an inlet of the
sea, which forms its harbour; to the south is the
main sea, or, more strictly, the channel of Zara lying
between the Dalmatian coast and the barren islands
which at this point lie off it. Villehardouin describes
the port as being guarded by a chain, which was
broken by the galleys of the Crusaders. They presently
landed on the opposite coast, so as to have the
haven between them and the town ("et descendirent
à terre, si que di porz fu entr' aus et la ville"). That
is to say, they landed on the mainland north of the
haven. The Frank army then besieged the city by
land&mdash;that is, from the isthmus on the east, and
perhaps also from the shore of the haven; while the
Venetians, though their ships anchored in the haven
("le port ou les nés estoient"), made their assault on
the side of the open sea ("devers la mer"). On the
spot, or in reading the narrative of Villehardouin by
the light of remembrance of the spot, the description
becomes perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Zara still keeps its peninsular site, and the traveller,
as he draws near, still marks the fortifications, old and
new, the many towers, no one of which so predominates
over its fellows as to make itself the chief
object in the view. Either however the modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Venetian and Austrian fortifications of Zara are less
formidable, in appearance at least, than those which
the Crusaders found there, or else they seemed more
terrible to those who had actually to undertake the
business of attacking them. Villehardouin had never
seen such high walls and towers, nor, though he had
just come from Venice, could he conceive a city fairer
or more rich. The pilgrims were amazed at the sight,
and wondered how they could ever become masters
of such a place, unless God specially put it into their
hands. The modern traveller, as he draws nearer, soon
sees the signs of the success which the pilgrims so
little hoped for. He sees the badge of Venetian rule
over the water-gate, and most likely he little suspects
that the outer arch, of manifest Venetian date, masks
a plain Roman arch which is to be seen on the inner
side. There is another large Venetian gate towards
the inlet; and the traveller who at Zara first lands on
Dalmatian ground will find on landing much to
remind him that Dalmatian ground once was Venetian
ground. The streets are narrow and paved; they are
not quite as narrow as in Venice, nor is the passage of
horses and all that horses draw so absolutely unknown
as it is in Venice. Still the subject city comes near
enough to its mistress to remind us under whose
dominion Zara stayed for so many ages. And the
traveller who begins his Dalmatian studies at Zara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
will perhaps think Dalmatia is not so strange and
out-of-the-way a land as he had fancied before going
thither. He may be tempted to look on Zara simply
as an Italian town, and to say that an Italian town
east of the Hadriatic is not very unlike an Italian
town on the other side. This feeling, not wholly true
even at Zara, will become more and more untrue as
the traveller makes his way further along the coast.
Each town, as he goes on, will become less Italian and
more Slavonic. In street architecture Zara certainly
stands behind some of the other Dalmatian towns.
We see fewer of those windows of Venetian and
Veronese type which in some places meet us in
almost every house. The Roman remains are not
very extensive. We have said that Jadera still keeps
a Roman arch under a Venetian mask. That arch
keeps its pilasters and its inscription, but the statues
which, according to that inscription, once crowned it,
have given way to another inscription of Venetian
times. Besides the <i>Porta Marina</i>, two other visible
memorials of earlier days still exist in the form of
two ancient columns standing solitary, one near the
church of Saint Simeon, presently to be spoken of,
the other in the herb-market between the <i>duomo</i> and
the haven. But the main interest of Zara, apart
from its general and special history, and apart from
the feeling of freshness in treading a land so famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
and so little known, is undoubtedly to be found in its
ecclesiastical buildings.</p>

<p>The churches of Zara are certainly very much such
churches as might be looked for in any Italian city of
the same size. But they specially remind us of Lucca.
The cathedral, now metropolitan, church of Saint
Anastasia, has had its west front engraved in more
than one book, from Sir Gardner Wilkinson downwards;
it is a pity that local art has not been stirred
up to produce some better memorial of this and the
other buildings of Zara than the wretched little
photographs which are all that is to be had on the
spot. But perhaps not much in the way of art is to
be looked for in a city where, as at Trieste and Ancona
and Rome herself, it seems to be looked on as adding
beauty to the inside of a church to swathe marble
columns and Corinthian capitals in ugly wrappings of
red cloth. This at least seems to be an innovation
since the days of the Imperial topographer. Constantine
speaks of the church of Saint Anastasia as
being of oblong, that is, basilican, shape&mdash;<span class="greek" title="dromikos">&#948;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>
is his Greek word&mdash;with columns of green and white
marble, enriched with much ancient woodwork, and
having a tesselated pavement, which the Emperor, or
those from whom he drew his report of Zara, looked
on as wonderful. It is very likely that some of the
columns which in the tenth century were clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
allowed to stand naked and to be seen have been
used up again in the present church. This was built
in the thirteenth century, after the destruction wrought
in the Frank and Venetian capture, and it is said to
have been consecrated in 1285. It is, on the whole,
a witness to the way in which the Romanesque style
so long stood its ground, though here and there is a
touch of the coming pseudo-Gothic, and, what is far
more interesting to note, here and there is a touch
of the Romanesque forms of the lands beyond the
Alps. The church is, in its architectural arrangements,
a great and simple basilica; but, as might be
expected from its date, it shows somewhat of that
more elaborate way of treating exteriors which had
grown up at Pisa and Lucca. The west front has
surface arcades broken in upon by two wheel windows,
the lower arcade with round, the upper with pointed,
arches. Along the north aisle runs an open gallery,
which, oddly enough, is not carried round the apse.
The narrow windows below it are round in the eastern
part, trefoiled in the western, showing a change of
design as the work went on. Near the east end stands
the unfinished campanile; a stage or two of good
Romanesque design is all that is finished. The one
perfect ancient tower in Zara is not that of the <i>duomo</i>.</p>

<p>On entering the church, we at once feel how much
the building has suffered from puzzling and disfiguring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
modern changes. But this is not all; the general
effect of the inside has been greatly altered by
a change which we cannot bring ourselves wholly
to condemn. The choir is lifted up above the crypt
as at Saint Zeno and Saint Ambrose; the stone
chair still remains in the apse; but the object which
chiefly strikes the eye is one which is hardly in harmony
with these. The choir is fitted up with a range
of splendid <i>cinque cento</i> stalls&mdash;reminding one of
King's College chapel or of Wimborne as it once was&mdash;placed
in the position usual in Western churches.
This last feature, grand in itself, takes away from the
perfection of the basilican design, and carries us away
into Northern lands.</p>

<p>Of the church which preceded the Venetian rebuilding,
the church described by Constantine, little
remains above ground, allowing of course for the great
likelihood that the columns were used up again.
There is nothing to which one is even tempted to give
an early date, except some small and plain buildings
clinging on to the north side of the choir, and containing
the tomb of an early bishop. But in the
crypt, though it has unluckily lost two of its ranges
of columns, two rows, together with those of the apse,
are left, columns with finished bases but with capitals
which are perfectly rude, but whose shape would allow
them to be carved into the most elaborate Byzantine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
forms. The main arcades of the church form a range
of ten bays or five pair of arches, showing a most
singular collection of shapes which are not often seen
together. Some are simple Corinthian; in others
Corinthian columns are clustered&mdash;after the example
of Vespasian's temple at Brescia; others have twisted
fluting; one pair has a section, differing in the two
opposite columns, which might pass for genuine
Northern work; while&mdash;here in Dalmatia in the
thirteenth century&mdash;not a few shafts are crowned with
our familiar Norman cushion capital. Yet the effect
of the whole range would be undoubtedly fine, if we
were only allowed to see it. The hideous red rags
have covered even the four columns of the <i>baldacchino</i>,
columns fluted and channelled in various ways and
supporting pointed arches. They have also diligently
swathed the floriated cornice above the arcade; in
short, wherever there is any fine work, Jaderan taste
seems at once to hide it; but nothing hides the
clerestory with its stable windows or the flat plastered
ceiling which crowns all. The triforium has an air of
Jesuitry; but it seems to be genuine, only more or
less plastered; six small arches, with channelled
square piers, which would not look out of place at
Rome, at Autun, or at Deerhurst, stand over each pair
of arches. With all its original inconsistencies and
its later changes, the <i>duomo</i> of Zara, if it were only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
stripped of its swaddling-clothes, would be no contemptible
specimen of its own style.</p>

<p class="caption">TOWER OF ST. MARY'S ZARA.</p>

<p>But Saint Anastasia is not the only, it is hardly
the most interesting, church in Zara. Saint Chrysogonos,
monk and martyr, was held in reverence at
Diadora in the days of Constantine, where his tomb
and his holy chain were to be seen. Perhaps they
are to be seen still; certainly his name is still preserved
in an admirable church of the same general
Lucchese type as the <i>duomo</i>, but which surpasses it
in the exquisite grace of the three apses at its east
end, after the best models of the type common to
Italy and Germany. Within, the arrangement of the
triapsidal basilica is perfect; the range of columns is,
as is so often found, interrupted by two pairs of more
massive piers, making groups of three, two, and two
arches. It is almost startling to find that the date of
the consecration of this exquisite Romanesque church
is as late as 1407; but the fact is only one example
out of many of the way in which in some districts,
in Dalmatia above all, the true style of the land stood
its ground. In Dalmatia the Italian pseudo-Gothic,
common in houses, is but little seen in churches at
any time. Another church, Saint Simeon, called after
the Prophet of <i>Nunc dimittis</i>, boasts of its gorgeous
shrine borne aloft behind the high altar, the gift of
Elizabeth of Bosnia, the wife of Lewis the Great.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
The church itself is of the same basilican type as
the other, but in less good preservation. Saint Mary's,
a church of nuns, is itself of a rather good kind of
<i>Renaissance</i>, but its chief merit is that it keeps the
only finished ancient tower in Zara, a noble campanile
of the best Italian type, thick with midwall
shafts, which every Englishman will feel to be the
true kinsman of our own towers at Lincoln and
Oxford. Its date is known; it is the work of King
Coloman of Hungary, in 1105. But, after all, the
most interesting architectural work in Zara is one
which, as far as we have seen, is not noticed in any
English book, but which was described by the Imperial
pen in the tenth century, and which has in
our own days been more fully illustrated in the
excellent work of Eitelberger on the Dalmatian buildings.
Close by Saint Anastasia there stood in the
days of Constantine, and there still stands, a round
church, lately desecrated, now simply disused, which
was then called by the name of the Trinity (<span class="greek" title="heteros
naos plêsion autou eilêmatikos, hê hagia Trias">&#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#957;&#945;&#8056;&#962; &#960;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#949;&#7984;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962;, &#7969; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#945; &#932;&#961;&#953;&#940;&#962;
</span>), but
which now bears that of Saint Donatus. Its dome
and the tower of Saint Mary's are the two objects
which first catch the eye in the general view of
Zara. Tradition, as usual, calls the building a pagan
temple, in this case of Juno; but it has in no way
the look of a temple, nor does the Emperor who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
describes it with some minuteness give any hint of
its having been such. Yet it is plain that, if it was
not itself a pagan building, the spoils of pagan buildings
contributed to its materials. Formed of two
arcaded stages, the whole pile rises to a vast height,
and the height of the lower stage alone is very considerable.
The arches of the round rest on heavy
rectangular piers of truly Roman strength, save only
two vast columns with splendid Composite capitals&mdash;which
mark the approach to the triapsidal east end.
This building, lately cleared from the disfigurements
and partition of its profane use, forms one of the
noblest round churches to be found; the so-called
house of Juno at Zara is almost a rival of the so-called
house of Jupiter at Spalato. The upper stage
is of the same general type as the lower, having again
two columns left free and uninjured, but not rivalling
the splendour of those which are in bondage
below. Zara had lately another desecrated church
of extreme interest, but of quite another type from
Saint Donatus. This was the little church of Saint
Vitus, a perfect example of the genuine Byzantine
arrangement on a very small scale. The ground-plan
was square; four arms, square-ended without, quasi-apsidal
within, bore up the cupola on perfectly plain
square-edged piers. Between our first and second
visits to Zara, between 1875 and 1877, this charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
little piece of Byzantine work was swept away to
make a smart shop-front. It was a recompense no
more than was due to find on our third visit that the
round church had been cleared out.</p>

<p class="p2">Such is Zara, a city in which, as at Parenzo, the
ecclesiastical element distinctly prevails, as contrasted
with the mainly pagan interest of Pola. Such is
equally the case in our next Dalmatian city also.
But the main interest of Sebenico is of a different
kind from that of any of its fellows. We go there
to study a church, but, as we have seen, a church
which has little in common with other churches
in Dalmatia or anywhere else. At Zara, at Spalato,
at Ragusa, we study buildings which all in some
sort hang together. At Sebenico we stop our course
to study something which stands altogether aloof
from all.

<h2>SPALATO AND ITS NEIGHBOURS.</h2>

<h3>SPALATO.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>
<h4>1875.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The main object and centre of all historical and
architectural inquiries on the Dalmatian coast is of
course the home of Diocletian, the still abiding palace
of Spalato. From a local point of view, it is the spot
which the greatest of the long line of renowned
Illyrian Emperors chose as his resting-place from the
toils of warfare and government, and where he reared
the vastest and noblest dwelling that ever arose at
the bidding of a single man. From an &oelig;cumenical
point of view, Spalato is yet more. If it does not rank
with Rome, Old and New, with Ravenna and with
Trier, it is because it never was, like them, an actual
seat of empire. But it not the less marks a stage,
and one of the greatest stages, in the history of the
Empire. On his own Dalmatian soil, Docles of Salona,
Diocletian of Rome, was the man who had won fame
for his own land, and who, on the throne of the
world, did not forget his provincial birthplace. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
the sight of Rome and of the world Jovius Augustus
was more than this. Alike in the history of politics
and in the history of art, he has left his mark on all
time that has come after him, and it is on his own
Spalato that his mark has been most deeply stamped.
The polity of Rome and the architecture of Rome
alike received a new life at his hands. In each alike
he cast away shams and pretences, and made the
true construction of the fabric stand out before
men's eyes. Master of the Roman world, if not King,
yet more than King, he let the true nature of his
power be seen, and, first among the Cæsars, arrayed
himself with the outward pomp of sovereignty. In
a smaller man we might have deemed the change
a mark of weakness, a sign of childish delight in
gewgaws, titles, and trappings. Such could hardly
have been the motive in the man who, when he
deemed that his work was done, could cast away both
the form and the substance of power, and could so
steadily withstand all temptations to take them up
again. It was simply that the change was fully
wrought; that the chief magistrate of the commonwealth
had gradually changed into the sovereign
of the Empire; that Imperator, Cæsar, and Augustus,
once titles lowlier than that of King, had now become,
as they have ever since remained, titles far loftier.
The change was wrought, and all that Diocletian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
did was to announce the fact of the change to the
world. So again, now that the Roman city had grown
into the Roman world, a hill by the Tiber had long
ceased to be a fit dwelling-place for rulers who had
to keep back hostile inroads from the Rhine and the
Euphrates. This fact too Diocletian announced to the
world. He planted his Augusti and his Cæsars on
spots better suited for defence against the German
and the Persian than the spot which had been chosen
for defence against the Sabine and the Etruscan.
Jupiter of the Capitol and his representatives on earth
were to be equally at home in every corner of their
dominions. Nor is it wonderful if, with such aims
before him, he deemed that a faith which taught
that Jupiter of the Capitol was a thing of naught
was a faith which it became his votary to root
out from all the lands that bowed to Jove and to
Jovius. What if his work in some sort failed? what
if his system of fourfold rule broke up before his
own eyes&mdash;if his Bithynian capital soon gave way
to the wiser choice of a successor, if the faith which
he persecuted became, almost on the morrow, the
faith of his Empire? Still his work did not wholly
fail. He taught that Empire was more than kingship,
a lesson never forgotten by those who, for fifteen
hundred years after him, wore the diadem of Diocletian
rather than of Augustus. In some sort he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
founded the Roman Empire. What Constantine did
was at once to undo and to complete his work by
making that Empire Holy.</p>

<p>Such a man, if not actually a creator, yet so pre-eminently
one who moulded the creations of others
into new shapes, might well take to himself a name
from the supreme deity of his creed, the deity of
whom he loved to be deemed the special votary. The
conception which had grown up in the mind, and had
been carried out by the hand, of the peasant of Salona
might well entitle him to his proud surname. Nor
did the organizing hand of Jovius confine its sphere
to the polity of the Empire only. He built himself
an house, and, above all builders, he might boast
himself of the house that he had builded. Fast by
his own birthplace&mdash;a meaner soul might have chosen
some distant spot&mdash;Diocletian reared the palace which
marks a still greater epoch in Roman art than his
political changes mark in Roman polity. On the
inmost shore of one of the lake-like inlets of the
Hadriatic, an inlet guarded almost from sight by
the great island of Bua at its mouth, lay his own
Salona, now desolate, then one of the great cities of
the Roman world. But it was not in the city, it was
not close under its walls, that Diocletian fixed his
home. An isthmus between the bay of Salona and
the outer sea cuts off a peninsula, which again throws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
out two horns into the water to form the harbour
which has for ages supplanted Salona. There, not on
any hill-top, but on a level spot by the coast, with
the sea in front, with a background of more distant
mountains, and with one peaked hill rising between
the two seas like a watch-tower, did Diocletian build
the house to which he withdrew when he deemed that
his work of empire was over. And in building that
house, he won for himself, or for the nameless genius
whom he set at work, a place in the history of art
worthy to rank alongside of Iktinos of Athens and
Anthemios of Byzantium, of William of Durham and
of Hugh of Lincoln.</p>

<p>And now the birthplace of Jovius is forsaken, but
his house still abides, and abides in a shape marvellously
little shorn of its ancient greatness. The name
which it still bears comes straight from the name of
the elder home of the Cæsars. The fates of the two
spots have been in a strange way the converse of one
another. By the banks of the Tiber the city of
Romulus became the house of a single man; by the
shores of the Hadriatic the house of a single man
became a city. The Palatine hill became the <i>Palatium</i>
of the Cæsars, and <i>Palatium</i> was the name which was
borne by the house of Cæsar by the Dalmatian shore.
The house became a city; but its name still clave to
it, and the house of Jovius still, at least in the mouths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
of its own inhabitants, keeps its name in the slightly
altered form of Spálato.</p>

<p>He placed his home in a goodly land, on a spot
whose first sight is striking at any moment; but
special indeed is the good luck of him who for the
first time draws near to Spalato at the hour of sunset.
It is a moment to be marked in a life, as we round
the island headland, one of the stony Dalmatian hills
rising bleak and barren from the sea, and catch the
first glimpse of the city, the tall bell-tower, the proud
rampart of mountains which forms its background.
But the sight is more spirit-stirring still if we come
on that sight at the very moment when&mdash;in sight of
the home of the great persecutor we may use the
language of mythology&mdash;the sun-god has just sunk
into its golden cup. The sinking sun seems no unfit
symbol, as we look on the spot where the lord of
the world withdrew to seek for rest after his toils.
Another moment, the headland is rounded; its top is
kindled like Vesuvius in the last rays of the sunlight;
the lesser light is kindled before the greater has
wholly failed us, and, by the light of sun and moon
together, we can trace out the long line of the sea-front
of the palace which became a city. No nobler
site could surely have been found within the bounds
of the Empire of the two Augusti and their Cæsars.
The sea in front, the mountains behind, the headlands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
the bays, the islands scattered around, might indeed
have formed a realm from which the prince who had
there fixed his home would have been unwise to go
forth again to wrestle with the storms of the world
which lay beyond its borders. The mountains have
drawn nearer to the shore; the islands have gathered
round the entrance of the haven, as if to shut out all
but the noble bay and its immediate surroundings, as
if to fence in a dominion worthy of Jovius himself.</p>

<p>We land with the moon lighting up the water,
with the stars above us, the northern wain shining
on the Hadriatic, as if, while Diocletian was seeking
rest by Salona, the star of Constantine was rising
over York and Trier. Dimly rising above us we
see, disfigured indeed, but not destroyed, the pillared
front of the palace, reminding us of the Tabularium
of Rome's own Capitol. We pass under gloomy
arches, through dark passages, and presently we find
ourselves in the centre of palace and city, between
those two renowned rows of arches which mark the
greatest of all epochs in the history of the building
art. We think how the man who re-organized the
Empire of Rome was also the man who first put
harmony and consistency into the architecture of
Rome. We think that, if it was in truth the crown
of Diocletian which passed to every Cæsar from the
first Constantius to the last Francis, it was no less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
in the pile which rose into being at his word that
the germ was planted which grew into Pisa and
Durham, into Westminster and Saint Ouen's. There
is light enough to mark the columns put for the first
time to their true Roman use, and to think how
strange was the fate which called up on this spot the
happy arrangement which had entered the brain of
no earlier artist&mdash;the arrangement which, but a few
years later, was to be applied to another use in the
basilica of the Lateran and in Saint Paul without the
walls. Yes, it is in the court of the persecutor, the
man who boasted that he had wiped out the Christian
superstition from the world, that we see the noblest
forestalling of the long arcades of the Christian
basilica. It is with thoughts like these, thoughts
pressing all the more upon us where every outline
is clear and every detail is invisible, that we tread
for the first time the Court of Jovius&mdash;the columns
with their arches on either side of us, the vast bell-tower
rising to the sky, as if to mock the art of
those whose mightiest works might still seem only to
grovel upon earth. Nowhere within the compass of
the Roman world do we find ourselves more distinctly
in the presence of one of the great minds of the
world's history; we see that, alike in politics and in
art, Diocletian breathed a living soul into a lifeless
body. In the bitter irony of the triumphant faith,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
his mausoleum has become a church, his temple has
become a baptistery, the great bell-tower rises proudly
over his own work; his immediate dwelling-place is
broken down and crowded with paltry houses; but
the sea-front and the Golden Gate are still there amid
all disfigurements, and the great peristyle stands
almost unhurt, to remind us of the greatest advance
that a single mind ever made in the progress of the
building art.</p>

<p class="caption">THE TOWER, SPALATO.</p>
</div>

<p>At the present time the city into which the house
of Diocletian has grown is the largest and most
growing town of the Dalmatian coast. It has had to
yield both spiritual and temporal precedence to Zara,
but, both in actual population and all that forms the
life of a city, Spalato greatly surpasses Zara and all
its other neighbours. The youngest of the Dalmatian
towns, which could boast neither of any mythical
origin nor of any Imperial foundation, the city which,
as it were, became a city by mere chance, has outstripped
the colonies of Epidauros, of Corinth, and of
Rome. The palace of Diocletian had but one occupant;
after the founder no Emperor had dwelled in
it, unless we hold that this was the villa near Salona
where the deposed Emperor Nepos was slain, during
the patriciate of Odoacer. The forsaken palace seems,
while still almost new, to have become a cloth factory,
where women worked, and which therefore appears in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the Notitia as a Gynæcium. But when Salona was
overthrown, the palace stood ready to afford shelter
to those who were driven from their homes. The
palace, in the widest sense of the word&mdash;for of course
its vast circuit took in quarters for soldiers and
officials of various kinds, as well as the rooms actually
occupied by the Emperor&mdash;stood ready to become a
city. It was a <i>chester</i> ready made, with its four streets,
its four gates, all but that towards the sea flanked
with octagonal towers, and with four greater square
towers at the corners. To this day the circuit of the
walls is nearly perfect; and the space contained within
them must be as large as that contained within some
of the oldest <i>chesters</i> in our own island. The walls,
the towers, the gates, are those of a city rather than of
a house. Two of the gates, though their towers are
gone, are nearly perfect: the <i>porta aurea</i>, with its
graceful ornament; the <i>porta ferrea</i> in its stern plainness,
strangely crowned with its small campanile of
later days perched on its top. Within the walls,
besides the splendid buildings which still remain,
besides the broken-down walls and chambers which
formed the immediate dwelling-place of the founder,
the main streets were lined with massive arcades,
large parts of which still remain. Diocletian, in
short, in building a house, had built a city. In the
days of Constantine Porphyrogenitus it was a <span class="greek" title="kastron">&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>&mdash;Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and English had by his day alike borrowed
the Latin name; but it was a <span class="greek" title="kastron">&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> which Diocletian
had built as his own house, and within which
was his hall and palace. In his day the city bore
the name of Aspalathon, which he explains to mean
<span class="greek" title="palation mikron">&#960;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#957;
</span>. When the palace had thus become
a common habitation of men, it is not wonderful that
all the more private buildings whose use had passed
away were broken down, disfigured, and put to mean
uses. The work of building over the site must have
gone on from that day to this. The view in Wheler
shows several parts of the enclosure occupied by ruins
which are now covered with houses. The real wonder
is that so much has been spared and has survived
to our own days. And we are rather surprised to
find Constantine saying that in his time the greater
part had been destroyed. For the parts which must
always have been the stateliest remain still. The
great open court, the peristyle, with its arcades, have
become the public piazza of the town; the mausoleum
on one side of it and the temple on the other were
preserved and put to Christian uses. We say the
mausoleum, for we fully accept the suggestion made
by Professor Glavinich, the curator of the museum
of Spalato, that the present <i>duomo</i>, traditionally called
the temple of Jupiter, was not a temple, but a
mausoleum. These must have been the great public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
buildings of the palace, and, with the addition of the
bell-tower, they remain the chief public buildings
of the modern city. But, though the ancient square
of the palace remains wonderfully perfect, the modern
city, with its Venetian defences, its Venetian and
later buildings, has spread itself far beyond the walls
of Diocletian. But those walls have made the history
of Spalato, and it is the great buildings which stand
within them that give Spalato its special place in
the history of architecture. In the face of them we
hardly stop to think of the remains of Venetian or
even of earlier times. Yet both within and without
the palace walls, scraps of Venetian work may be
found which would attract the eye on any other spot,
and hard by the north-western tower of Diocletian
there remains a small desecrated church of the
Byzantine type, which out of Spalato might be set
down as a treasure. But, as we stand beneath the
arcades of Jovius, things which would elsewhere be
treasures seem as nothing. They, and the other
buildings which stand in artistic connexion with
them, form an epoch in the history of art, apart from
the general history and general impression of the
city which they have at once created and made
famous.</p>

<h3>SPALATO REVISITED.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>
<h4>1877&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>I thought it right to reprint the foregoing sketch of Spalato, the
record of my first visit there in 1875, exactly as it was first written,
with the change of two or three words only. It seemed worth while
to keep the first impressions of such a place as they were set down
at once after the first sight of it. Instead therefore of recasting
this piece, as I have done several of the others, I will mention a
few points on which later visits and further reading might have led
to some change in what I first wrote nearly on the spot. Another
paper of a strictly architectural character, headed "Diocletian's
Place in Architectural History," has been reprinted in the third
series of my Historical Essays, as an appendix to the essay headed
"The Illyrian Emperors and their Land."</p>

<p>First, with regard to the name of the place itself. I seem, when
I wrote my paper of first impressions, to have had no doubt as to
the received derivation from <i>Palatium</i>. That derivation is wonderfully
tempting, and it enables one to make an epigrammatic contrast
between the <i>Palatium</i> of Rome and the <i>Palatium</i> of Spalato, between
the city which became a house and the house which became
a city. But the fact remains the same, whatever may be the name.
The city did become a house, and the house did become a city,
whether the two were called by the same name or not. And I am
now convinced, chiefly by Mr. Arthur Evans, that the name of
Spalato has nothing to do with <i>Palatium</i>. I began to doubt rather
early, as I did not see how the <b>s</b> could have got into the name; in
a Greek name the origin of the <b>s</b> would have been plain enough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
but it seemed to have no place in a Latin name. And I was staggered
by the form <i>Aspalato</i> found as early as the Notitia Imperii. Nothing
goes for less than the etymologies of Constantine Porphyrogenitus,
and anyhow it is hard to see how <span class="greek" title="Aspalathon">&#7944;&#963;&#960;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#957;</span>, the form which he
uses, could mean <span class="greek" title="mikron palation">&#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>. But, as I had nothing better
to propose, I thought it better, when I wrote the fuller paper
which appears in the Historical Essays, to say nothing about the
matter either way. I need not stop to dispute against the intrusive
r in the vulgar form <i>Spalatro</i>, as both Sir Gardner Wilkinson and
Mr. Neale have done that before me. But it is wonderful to see
how early it got in. It is as old as the Ravenna Geographer, who
has three forms&mdash;<i>Spalathon</i>, <i>Spalathron</i>, and <i>Spalatrum</i>. I need
hardly say that the <i>r</i> is unknown in the country, unless perhaps
now and then in the mouth of some one who thinks it fine. So
one has known people in England destroy etymology, by sounding
<i>Waltham</i> as if it had a <i>thorn</i>, and <i>Bosham</i> with the sound of the
German <i>sch</i>. I am now fully convinced that the name has nothing
to do with <i>Palatium</i>. It is plain that the oldest form that we can
find is <i>Aspalathum</i>, and I am inclined to accept the view of Mr.
Evans, who connects the name with <i>Aspalathus</i>, or perhaps with
<span class="greek" title="asphaltos">&#7940;&#963;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>. But I must not venture myself in any quarter which
savours of botany or geology.</p>

<p>With the newer lights which I have made use of in Historical
Essays, I think I should no longer speak of Diocletian as "the great
persecutor." Galerius ought in fairness to take that name off his
shoulders. Mr. A. J. Mason has certainly proved thus much; and
it is a great comfort to think so in visiting Spalato. Nor should
I have spoken of him as a native of Salona. He was of Doclea,
Dioclea, however we are to spell it, within the present bounds of
Tzernagora. Those who at various times have spoken of Saint
Alban as "protomartyr <i>Anglorum</i>," and of King Lucius as becoming
"a <i>Swiss</i> bishop," might also speak of Diocletian as a Montenegrin.</p>

<p>I was doubtless right in saying that no Emperor, strictly so
called, inhabited the Palace after Diocletian. In strictness indeed
no Emperor ever inhabited it at all, as Diocletian had ceased to be
Emperor when he went there. But I think that, at the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
my first visit, I had not fully taken in the story of Nepos and his
father Count Marcellian. One is strongly tempted to think that,
when Nepos was killed "haud longe a Salonis, sua in villa," the
place meant is the palace of Spalato. On the other hand, we have
the earlier entry in the Notitia, which certainly looks as if the
palace had already become a kind of Imperial factory. But Nepos
would hardly live in the same style as Jovius, and the palace is
quite big enough to lodge the deposed Emperor and the work-women
at the same time.</p>

<p>On the special importance of Spalato in the history of architecture
I have spoken in several places, specially in the paper in my
Historical Essays to which I have already referred. My main
position is that, in the palace at Spalato, after a series of approaches,
many of which may be seen in the building itself, Diocletian or
his architect hit on the happy device of making the arch spring
directly from the capital of the column. To merely classical critics
this seems to mark the depth of degradation into which art had
fallen in Diocletian's day. To me it seems to be the greatest step
ever taken, the beginning of all later forms of consistent arched
architecture, Romanesque, Gothic, or any other. The importance
of the step is of course the same whoever took it; and if the same
feature can be shown in any building earlier than Spalato, we must
transfer our praises from, the designer of Spalato to the designer
of that building. Spalato would in that case lose something of its
strictly architectural interest; but that would be all. But, as far
as I know, no such rival has appeared. If the same form really
was used in the baths of Diocletian at Rome, that would not be a
rival building, but a case of the same mind working in the same
way in two places. And to establish an earlier use of the form, it
would be needful to show that it was deliberately employed in
some considerable building. There is nothing commoner in the
history of architecture than the casual and isolated appearance of
some form, which the designer had not so much chosen as stumbled
on, long before the time when it really came into use. I put in this
caution, because I know that there is a kind of feeble approach to
the arrangement at Spalato in one or two buildings at Pompeii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
And, great as was the advance at Spalato, it had, like many other
cases of advance, its weak side. The Ravenna stilt and the
Byzantine double capital were both of them shifts to relieve, as it
were, the light abacus of the Corinthian capital from the weight
which the arch laid upon it. The heavy abacus of Pisa and Lucca
was a better escape from this difficulty. Again, the lightness of
the columns used at Spalato and in the basilicas which followed its
model forbade the use of the vault, and condemned the roofs of the
basilicas to be among their poorest features. In the peristyle itself
of course no roof was needed, though to an eye used to Rome and
Ravenna it has so much the air of an unroofed basilica that it is
really hard to believe that it was always open. But, though the
basilican arrangement forbade the use of the vault, yet the step
taken at Spalato was not without its effect on later vaulted buildings.
When the vault came in again, as in the heavier forms of
the German Romanesque, men had learned that the arch and its
pier, whether that pier was a light column or a massive piece of
wall, were enough for all artistic purposes, without bringing in, as
in the classical Roman, purely ornamental features from a style
which followed another system of construction. I came to my
belief in the architectural importance of Spalato thirty years before
I saw the building itself, and, now that repeated visits have made
the peristyle of Diocletian as familiar to me as Wells cathedral,
I admire and approve just as much, though of course I cannot
undertake to be quite as enthusiastic now as I was on the evening
when I first saw it.</p>

<p>When I was last at Spalato, a process was going on which always
makes one tremble. The peristyle and the inside of the mausoleum
were surrounded by scaffoldings. As for the mausoleum, it was
perhaps a mistake ever to make it into a church; but, as it has been
made into a church, the additions and changes which were needed
for that purpose have become part of the history, and ought not
to be meddled with. It must always have been nearly the smallest,
and quite the darkest, metropolitan church in Christendom; but
that it is so is part of the wonder of the place. And, if some of
the details were restored in plaster at the time of a certain famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
royal visit, it seems hardly worth while to knock them away, with
the chance of knocking away some of the genuine stone along with
them. That royal visit is commemorated in a tablet at the end of
the peristyle, which professes great loyalty to a personage described
as "Franciscus Primus, Austriæ Imperator et Dalmatiæ Rex."
The man so labelled in Diocletian's own house had been the last
successor to Diocletian's empire.</p>

<p>In the changes which are being made in the peristyle, it
is said that this tablet was first taken down as being modern,
and then set up again, because official loyalty overrode all considerations
of what was old and what was new. But some care
should be taken in removing what is modern in such a place as
Spalato. It is very well to get rid of some mean excrescences;
but, where the arches have been filled up by Venetian buildings of
respectable work, it would seem to be a great mistake to open
them, to say nothing of the chance that such opening may endanger
the columns and arches themselves. Though built up, they are not
so blocked as to hinder a full study of their details. Indeed the
building up, both of the arches of the peristyle and of the heavier
arches in the other parts of the palace, is really a part of the history
which should be preserved. It marks the distinctive character of
Spalato as the house which became a city.</p>

<p>That city, as it now stands, stretches, I need hardly say again, a
long way beyond the bounds of the ancient house. Yet one cannot
conceive Spalato without Diocletian's palace. It is something much
more than the chief object and ornament of Spalato, as this or that
building is the chief object and ornament of any other city. It is
more than the castle or monastery round which a city has often grown.
It is not merely that, but for the existence of the palace, the city
would never have come into being; the palace still is the city in a
sense in which we could hardly use those words of any other building
elsewhere. Yet there are things to see at Spalato besides the palace.
The museum is eminently a thing to see; but then it is within
the palace, and moreover, though it is locally placed at Spalato,
it belongs historically to Salona. There is a good deal of pretty
Venetian work scattered up and down, both within the walls of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Diocletian and without them. The piazza just outside the gate of
iron, where the traveller will most likely seek his breakfast, his
coffee, and his maraschino, would have some attractions in itself, if
it did not lie just outside the gate of iron. The eye naturally
turns to the gate, and to the little campanile perched on it; otherwise
it might very fairly rest on the Venetian <i>loggia</i>, with its
columns and their wide&mdash;yet not sprawling&mdash;pointed arches. It
might rest none the less because the building so strongly suggests that
class of English town-halls or market-houses of which I said something
when speaking of Udine. The octagonal tower too, and the
remains of the Venetian fortifications generally, are worth a glance.
The difficulty is, in the home of Jovius, to give even a glance to
anything but the works of Jovius.</p>

<p>The mausoleum, now the once metropolitan church, and the
temple, now the baptistery, have both of them become churches
by accident. Besides these, the first impression is that Spalato has
little to show in the ecclesiastical line. And further examination
will not take away that impression as to quantity, though it will
modify it somewhat as to quality. The little desecrated church
which in 1875 I saw just within the palace walls, embodied in
military buildings, I could not find in 1881. I was told that it
had been burned, and there certainly was a burned building thereabouts;
but I did not feel quite sure that I had hit upon the right
site, and whether the church that I was looking for might not
still be there, imprisoned in some of the queer devices of Austrian
occupation. But in 1881 I and my companion lighted by way of
recompense on one most curious building which neither of us had
seen in earlier visits. This is the little church of Saint Nicolas in
the suburb on the slope of the hill. It is very small, of a rude kind
of Byzantine type, with four of the very strangest columns I ever
saw. Save that they have a mighty <i>entasis</i>, they really have more
of an Egyptian cut than anything Greek, Roman, Gothic, or any of
the forms to which Aryan eyes are used. The Franciscan church
at the foot of the hill, with its cloister, would be worth a glance
for its own sake; and it is worth much more than a glance on
account of the precious sarcophagus which the cloister shelters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
But this, like the objects in the museum, is an outlying fragment
of Salona, to be talked of there. To the modern church on the
other side of the city it would be only kindness to shut our eyes.
But we cannot help looking at it; it aims at the style of the place,
and clearly fancies itself to be Romanesque, if not Roman. We
look at its tower, and we look back to the mighty campanile
within the walls. Somehow the fourteenth century could adapt
itself to the fourth; but the nineteenth cannot adapt itself to the
fourteenth. Yet it is something for Spalato to say that it contains
the noblest and the most ignoble of all towers that do profess and
call themselves Romanesque.</p>

<p>Eitelberger has well hit off the character of the three chief
Dalmatian cities in three pithy epithets. Zara is <i>bureaukratisch</i>;
Spalato is <i>bürgerlich</i>; Ragusa is <i>alt-aristokratisch</i>. The burghers
seem to make more progress than either the foreign officials or the
native patricians. Both better quarters and better dinners can be
had at Spalato in 1881 than were to be had there in 1875. In 1881
we can walk on shore, while in 1877 boats were needed. And in
1881 the railway&mdash;a wonder in Dalmatia&mdash;was ready to carry us
to Salona or even to Sebenico, but not to Traü. On the other hand
in some other respects, if not Spalato, at least its foreign rulers,
seem to advance backwards, if they advance at all. Those who
dwell under the shadow of Apostolic Majesty are used to the daily
suppression of such newspapers as venture to proclaim inconvenient
truths. At Spalato that Apostolic and constitutional power has
gone a step further by suppressing the municipality. With us,
when a Stewart king suppressed an ancient corporation, he at least
set up another of a new Stewart fashion. But at Spalato the
<i>podestà</i>&mdash;the <i>potestas</i> still lingers in Dalmatia, while in Italy only
syndics are tolerated&mdash;and the other elders of the city seem to
have become altogether things of the past, no less than Jovius and
his Empire.</p>

<h3>SALONA.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1877&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The strictly classical student will perhaps be offended
if any one, on reading the name at the head of this
article, should ask him where the place is, and how its
name is to be pronounced. Salona, he will answer, is
in Dalmatia, and how can there be more than one
way of sounding the <i>omega</i> in the second syllable?
And so far he will be right. The Salona of which we
speak is in Dalmatia, and, as its most usual Greek
forms are <span class="greek" title="Salôna">&#931;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#945;</span> and <span class="greek" title="Salônai">&#931;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>, there can be no doubt
as to the rights of that particular <i>omega</i>. But those
who have gone a little deeper into the geography
of south-eastern Europe will know that, besides the
Dalmatian Salona, there is another within the Greek
kingdom, which has taken the place of the Lokrian
Amphissa. As we write the names of the two, we
make no difference between them, and we fear that
most Englishmen will make as little difference in
sounding the two names as in writing them. Yet, as
Boughton in Northamptonshire and Boughton in Kent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
are, by those who have local knowledge, sounded in
two different ways, so it is with the Lokrian and the
Dalmatian Salona. <span class="greek" title="Sálona">&#931;&#940;&#955;&#969;&#957;&#945;</span> and <span class="greek" title="Salôna">&#931;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#945;</span> differ to the
eye; and, among those with whom Greek is a living
tongue, they differ to the ear also. But it is not
with the Lokrian Sálona, but with the Dalmatian
Salóna, that we are here concerned. We need not
disturb the feelings of the late Bishop Monk, whose
one notion of accentual reading was that those who
follow it must "make some strange false quantities."
The classical purist may make the <i>omega</i> in the
Dalmatian Salóna as long as he pleases. Only, if he
pronounces the Lokrian Sálona in the same fashion, he
will wound the ears of those to whom the chief
notion of (so-called) quantitative reading is that those
who follow it must make some strange false accents.</p>

<p>At Salona we are in one of the subject lands of
Venice, but we cannot say that we are in one of her
subject cities. For Salona, as a city, had passed away
before the Serene Republic bore rule on these coasts,
in truth before the Serene Republic was, while the
lagoons still sheltered only those few settlers whom the
minister of Theodoric likened to waterfowl on their
nests. As a city, it passed away as few cities have passed
away. Others indeed have perished more thoroughly;
of some the very sites have been lost; but there is no
city whose name survives which has left so little trace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of what it was in the time of its greatness. For it is
not like those cities whose very name and memory
have perished, which are wholly ruined or buried,
which have no modern representatives, or whose modern
representatives bear wholly different names. Salona is
still an existing name, marked on at least the local map;
but, instead of the head of Dalmatia, one of the great
cities of the Roman Empire, a city which was said to
have reached half the size and population of the New
Rome itself, we find only a few scattered houses, which
hardly deserve the name of a village. By the side of
modern Salona, modern Aquileia looks flourishing, and
modern Forum Julii might pass for a great city. For
Aquileia is not wholly dead as long as the patriarchal
basilica still stands, if only to discharge the functions
of a village church. But at Salona the traveller
hardly notices whether there be any church in use
or not. Of modern objects the one which is most
likely to catch his eye is the building which at least
proclaims, in the name of "Caffè Diocleziano," that
Salona in her fall has not forgotten the man who
commonly passes for her greatest son, who, according
to some, was her second founder, and who, in any case,
was her most renowned neighbour. By a strange
piece of good luck, the citizen and sovereign of Salona
who came back to spend his last days in his own land
had reared at no great distance from her the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
which, when Salona fell, stood ready to receive her
inhabitants, and to take her place as a new city.</p>

<p>There is a marked difference between the position
of the older and that of the newer city. Spalato
stands indeed on a bay, but it is a bay which, in that
region of channels and islands, may pass for the open
sea. Salona lay at the innermost point of the deep
gulf which bears her own name, the gulf which forms
one side of the peninsula on which Spalato stands, and
which is shielded from the main sea by the island
of Bua. It is curious to compare the real geography
with the way in which the land and sea are laid down
in the Peutinger Table, where Bua seems nearer to
the coast of Italy than it is to Salona. Sir Gardner
Wilkinson appositely quotes the lines of Lucan:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Qua maris Hadriaci longas ferit unda Salonas,</p>
<p>Et tepidum in molles Zephyros excurrit Iader."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Longæ</i> certainly well expresses the way in which the
city must have spread itself along the mouth of the
river, and the northern side of the bay. And, more
than this, the idea of length must have been deeply
impressed on Salona by the long walls which, as we
shall presently see, yoked the city to something or
other beyond her own immediate defences. Salona,
like most of the older cities, was not at all like one of
our square <i>chesters</i> which rose up at once out of some
military necessity. The Dalmatian capital had grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
up bit by bit, and its walls formed a circuit almost as
irregular as that of Rome herself. The site was a
striking one. As we set forth from the comparatively
flourishing daughter to visit the fallen mother, the
road from Spalato leads us over a slight hill, from
the descent of which we look on the bay with its
background of mountains, a view which brings before
us two strongly contrasted sites of human habitation.
In advance of the mountain range stands the stronghold
of Clissa, so famous in later wars&mdash;a stronghold
most tempting in a distant view, but utterly disappearing
when we come near to it. The seat of the
Uscocs has nothing to show but its site and an ugly
fortress; yet the hill is well worth going up, for the
site and the view from it, a most instructive geographical
prospect over mainland, sea, and islands. We
turn to our Imperial guide, and we find that <span class="greek" title="Kleisa">&#922;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#945;
</span>
was so called because it kept the key of the passage
over the mountains. It was the <span class="greek" title="Kleisoura">&#922;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#961;&#945;
</span>, so called
<span class="greek" title="dia to synkleiein tous dierchomenous ekeithen">
&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#965;&#947;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#948;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#952;&#949;&#957;.
</span> He has to
tell us how it was taken by invaders, whom he speaks
of as the Slaves who were called Avars (<span class="greek" title="Slaboi, hoi kai
Abaroi kaloumenoi">&#931;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#953;, &#959;&#7985; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7948;&#946;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;
</span>). The ethnological confusion is
like that of another self-styled Imperial personage,
who thought that he could get at a Tartar by scratching
a Russian. But in both cases the confusion is
instructive, as pointing to the way in which Slavonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
and Turanian nations were mixed up together, as
allies and as enemies, in the history of these lands.
Far below, on the bosom of the bay, a group of small
islands are covered by a small village, which seems
to float on the water, and which well deserves its
name of <i>Piccola Venezia</i>. Between the height and
the sea lay Salona, on a slight elevation gently
sloping down to the water; here, as so often on the
Dalmatian coast, it needs somewhat of an effort to
believe that the water is the sea. To the right of the
road, we see the ruins of the aqueduct which brought
water to the house of Diocletian&mdash;an aqueduct lately
repaired, and again set to discharge its ancient duties.
Ancient fragments of one kind or another begin to
line the road; an ancient bridge presently leads us
across the main stream of the Giadro, Lucan's Iader,
which we might rather have looked for at Zara. We
mark to the right the marshy ground divided by the
many channels of the river; we pass by a square
castle with turreted corners, in which a mediæval
archbishop tried to reproduce the wonder of his own
city; and we at last find ourselves close by one of the
gates of Salona, ready to begin our examination of
the fallen city in due order.</p>

<p>The city distinctly consists of two parts. A large
suburb has at some time or another been taken in
within the walls of the city. This is plain, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
part of a cross wall with a gate still remains, which
must have divided the space contained within the
outer walls into two. This wall runs in a direction
which, without professing to be mathematically correct,
we may call north and south. That is, it runs
from the hills down towards the bay or the river.
Now, which was the elder part of the two? that to the
east or that to the west? In other words, which represents
the præ-Roman city, and which represents its
enlargement in Roman times? By putting the question
in this shape, we do not mean to imply that any
part of the existing walls is of earlier than Roman
date. The Roman city would arise on the site of the
earlier settlement, and, as it grew and as its circuit
was found too narrow, it would itself be further enlarged.
The cross wall with the gate in it must of
course have been at some time external; it marks the
extent of the city at the time when it was built; but
in which way has the enlargement taken place? It
used to be thought that the eastern, the most inland
division, was the elder, and that the city was extended
to the west. And it certainly at first sight looks in
favour of this view that, in the extreme north-west
corner, an amphitheatre has clearly been worked into
the wall, exactly in the same way in which the <i>Amphitheatrum
Castrense</i> at Rome is worked into the wall of
Aurelian. How so keen an observer as Sir Gardner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Wilkinson could have doubted about this building
being an amphitheatre, still more how his doubts
ended in his positively deciding that it was not, seems
really wonderful. It has all the unmistakeable features
of an amphitheatre, and we can only suppose that a
good deal has been brought to light since Sir Gardner
Wilkinson's visit, and that what is seen now was not
so clearly to be seen then. As amphitheatres were
commonly without the walls, this certainly looks as
if the eastern part were the old city, and as if those
who enlarged it to the west had made use of the
amphitheatre in drawing out their new line of fortification,
exactly as Aurelian in the like case made use of
amphitheatre, aqueducts, anything that came conveniently
in his way. But, on the other hand, Professor
Glavini&#269;, whom we have already referred to when
speaking of Spalato, and whose keener observation
has come usefully in the wake of the praiseworthy
researches of Dr. Carrara, has pointed out with
unanswerable force that the gate has two towers on its
eastern side, showing that that side was external, and
that therefore the western part must be the older and
the eastern the addition. This is evidence which it
is impossible to get over. Clearly then the space to
the west of it was once the whole city, and the far
greater space to the east once lay beyond the walls.
The gate must have been a grand one; but unluckily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
its arches have perished. There was a central opening,
along which the wheel-tracks may still be traced, and
a passage for foot-passengers on each side. The large
rectangular blocks of limestone of which it is built
have been encrusted in a singular way with some
natural formation, which might almost be mistaken
either for plaster or for some peculiarity of the stone
itself. In the northern wall of the eastern part is an
inscription commemorating the building or repair of
the wall in the time of the Antonines. This by itself
would not be conclusive; for the wall might very well
have been rebuilt in their day and the city might have
been enlarged to the west in a still later time. But
the position of the gate is decisive, and the position
of the amphitheatre is a difficulty that can easily be
got over. If, besides the great enlargement to the
east, we also suppose an enlargement to the west
which would take the amphitheatre within the city
walls, this will be quite enough.</p>

<p>We may rule then that the Illyrian city, the earlier
Roman city, stood to the west of the cross wall, and
that it was enlarged at some time earlier than the
reigns of the Antonines by taking in an eastern suburb
larger than the original town. The walls of both parts
may be traced through a large part of their extent.
The outer gate to the east was flanked by octagonal
towers, and both a square and an octagon tower may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
be traced near the north-east corner. But the most
remarkable thing about the walls of Salona is that,
besides the walls of the city itself, there are long
walls, like those of Athens and Megara, reaching from
the western side of the city for a mile and more nearly
along the present road to Traü. They have not been
traced to the end; but there can be no doubt that
they were built to make long Salona yet longer by
joining the town to some further point of the coast.
Nothing is more natural; the water of the bay by
Salona itself is very shallow; when the city became
one of the great maritime stations of the world, it was
an obvious undertaking to plant a dock at some point
of the coast where the water was deeper. And to one
who comes to Salona almost fresh from the hill-cities
of central Italy, from the strongholds of Volscians,
Hernicans, and Old-Latins, from Cora and Signia
and Alatrium, it becomes matter of unfeigned surprise
to find Dalmatian antiquaries speaking of these walls
as "Cyclopean." The name "Cyclopean," though as
old as Euripides, is as dangerous as "Pelasgian" or
"Druid;" but, if it means anything, it must mean the
first form of wall-building, the irregular stones heaped
together, such as we see in the oldest work at Cora
and Signia. Here we have nothing of the kind.
The blocks are very large, and the outer surface is
not smooth; but all of them are carefully cut to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
rectangular shape, and they are laid with great regularity.
There seems no kind of temptation to attribute
them to any date earlier than the Roman conquest of
Illyricum. The style of building is simply that which
is made natural by the kind of stone. And the same
kind of construction, though with smaller blocks, is
that which prevails throughout the walls of Salona,
except where later repairs have clearly been made.
This has happened with the outer wall to the west,
where some earlier fragments have even been built in.
Otherwise, by far the greater part of the walls, towers,
and gates of Salona, not forgetting a gate which has
been made out in the long walls themselves, all belong
to one general style of masonry.</p>

<p class="p2">Within the walls of Salona the general effect is
somewhat strange. The city is pierced by the road
from Spalato to Traü; in these later times it has been
further pierced by the railway&mdash;strange object in
Dalmatia, strangest of all at Salona&mdash;which starts from
Spalato, but which does not find its way to Traü. The
greater part of the space is still covered with vineyards
and olive-trees; systematic digging would bring a vast
deal to light; but a good deal positively has been
made out already. The amphitheatre has been already
spoken of; the road cuts through the theatre. But,
as becomes the history of the city, the greater part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the discoveries belong to Christian times, to the days
when the bishopric of Salona was a post great enough
to be employed to break the fall of deposed emperors.
But we may doubt whether the head church of Salona,
the church which held the episcopal chair of Glycerius,
has yet been brought to light.</p>

<p>Near the north-western corner of the eastern division
of the city the foundation of a Christian baptistery
has been uncovered. The site of the baptistery,
according to all rule, must be near to the site of the
great church of the city. Now the baptistery stands
near the wall; is it fanciful to think that at Salona,
as well as at Rome, it was not thought prudent in
the earliest days of the establishment of Christianity
to build churches in the more central and prominent
parts of the city? The baptistery of Salona keeps&mdash;the
great basilica must therefore have kept&mdash;under
the shadow of the wall of the extended city, exactly
as the Lateran basilica and baptistery do at Rome.
Of the baptistery it is easy to study the plan, as
the foundations and the bases of the columns, both
of the building itself and the portico in front of it,
are plainly to be seen. Many of their splendid
capitals are preserved among the rich treasures of the
museum at Spalato. These are of a Composite variety,
in which the part of the volute is played by griffins,
while the lower part of the capital is rich with foliage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
of a Byzantine type. West of the baptistery, but
hardly placed in any relation to it, are the remains
of a small church, which seems to have been a square,
with columns to the east and an apse to the north.
Whatever this building was, it surely can never have
been the great church of Salona. That must have
been a basilica of the first class; and we may hope
that future diggings may bring that to light also.
But outside the city to the north, successive diggings
have made precious discoveries in the way of Christian
burying-places and churches. Since the last researches
have been made, it is perfectly clear that here, outside
the walls, like the basilicas of the apostles at Rome,
there stood a church of considerable size, that it had
supplanted a smaller predecessor, and that it had
another smaller neighbour hard by. It is now easy&mdash;but
it is only very lately that it has become easy&mdash;to
see nearly the whole outline of a church measuring&mdash;speaking
roughly&mdash;about 120 feet long. It ranged
therefore with the smaller rather than the larger
basilicas of Rome. It had two rows of large columns,
which, from their nearness to one another, look as if
they had supported an entablature rather than arches,
with a transept, with the arch of triumph opening into
it, and the apse beyond, to the east. There are also,
in front of the arch of triumph, foundations which
look most temptingly like those of <i>cancelli</i>, like those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
of Saint Clement's at Rome, but which seem too narrow
for such a purpose. It is also plain, from the base of a
smaller column at a lower level, that this comparatively
large church was built on the remains of an earlier one.
And this is borne out by the discovery of pavements
at more than one level, which supported sarcophagi,
which are still to be seen, and of which an inscription
shows that the lowest level was of the time of Theodosius
the Second and Valentinian the Third. This thrusts
on the building of the upper and greater church to
a later time, surely not earlier than the reign of
Justinian. It must therefore have still been almost
in its freshness when the last blow fell on Salona.
And at such a time we can better take in the full force
of the inscription which stood over the west door:
"Dominus noster propitius esto reipublicæ Romanæ."
The church, it should be noted, has been, at some
time or other before it was quite swept away, patched
up or applied to some other use. A later wall runs
across the western face of the transept. An endless
field for guessing is hereby opened; but it is more
prudent not to enter upon it.</p>

<p>Another smaller ruined church stands close by, with
its apse pointing to the north. This and the eastern
part of the larger church are filled with sarcophagi
of all kinds and sizes, reminding us of the newly-opened
basilica of Saint Petronilla by the Appian Way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Among these is the tomb of an early <i>Chorepiscopus</i>. A
crowd of architectural fragments are scattered around,
among which one splendid Corinthian capital bears
witness to the magnificence of the upper church. But
the real wealth of Salona, both sepulchral and architectural,
is not to be looked for in Salona itself, but in
the museum at Spalato. There are a crowd of superb
tombs, pagan and Christian, and the splendid capitals
from the baptistery. There are stores of inscriptions,
Latin and Greek, which would make the place where
they are preserved a place of no small interest, even if
that place were not Spalato. But one sarcophagus of
pagan date still stays in its place, a little way beyond
the city, because, being hewn in the limestone rock,
it could not be taken away. This is that which is
described by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, which has some
of the exploits of Hêraklês carved on its one face, and
which has been so oddly changed in modern times into
the altar of the canonized Pope Saint Caius. For he,
like the Emperor under whom he suffered, passes for a
native of Salona. And a no less precious sarcophagus
of Christian days is preserved in the cloister of the
Franciscan church at Spalato. This represents the
crossing of the Red Sea. The Pharaoh looks very
much as if he were in a Roman triumphal chariot,
trampling a genius or two of the waters under his
wheels. His warriors follow, looking, according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
the eyes with which we look at them, like Romans
in military dress or like Albanians in the immemorial
fustanella. The Aryan mind is offended at seeing men
of another continent clothed in such a very European
garb; it is for Egyptologers to say whether the sculpture
is correct. The sea is very narrow; it swallows
up the Egyptian chariots with great force, and the
rescued Hebrews stand on the other side, Miriam just
about to begin her hymn of victory. The subject of
the sculpture is obvious; but it seems that nobody
understood it till it was expounded by an exalted lady
at that royal visit of 1818 which at Spalato is commemorated
oftener than enough. The expounder was
the wife of the man who had once been the last successor
of Diocletian and Augustus; whether his queen
had any claim to rank either as a successor of Prisca
and Livia or as the doubtful mother-in-law of a
conqueror from Ajaccio, we have not looked in any
pedigree-book to find out. One would really have
thought that the loosing of the knot was so easy that
it might have been unravelled by the hand of a
subject; but a book which we have before us by a local
antiquary goes off into raptures at the surprising keenness
of Imperial, Royal, and Apostolic eyes.</p>

<p>The chapel of Saint Caius, with its heathenish altar,
brings our thoughts back to the long walls below it,
the walls which yoked the ancient Salona to the deeper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
sea. It must not be forgotten that, in the days of
its greatness, Salona was one of the chief ports of the
Hadriatic, the greatest on its own side of it. After
shifting to and fro from one port to another, that
position has come back, if not to Salona itself, yet to its
modern representative. If we distinguish the Hadriatic
from the Gulf of Trieste, Spalato is undoubtedly its
chief port; but the smallness of Spalato, as compared
with the greatness of ancient Salona, is a speaking
historical lesson. We see the difference between the
place in Europe which is held by the Illyrian lands
now and the place which they held in the days of
the Roman peace. Then Salona was one of the chief
cities of the Roman world, placed on one of the most
central sites in the Roman world, the chief port of one
of the great divisions of the Empire, and one of the
main highways between its eastern and western halves.
Such could be the position of a Dalmatian city when
Dalmatia had a civilized mainland to the back of it.
Salona therefore kept up its position as long as the
Empire still kept any strength on its Illyrian frontier.
It played its part in both the civil wars. Cæsar
himself enlarges on the strength of the city&mdash;"oppidum
et loci natura et colle munitum." In after-times
it was a special object of the regard of its own
great citizen, who took up his abode so near to its
neighbourhood. According to Constantino Porphyrogenitus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Salona was pretty well rebuilt by Diocletian.
Its importance went on in the time of transition, as
is witnessed by the growth of its ecclesiastical buildings,
and by the high position held by its bishopric.
Like the rest of the neighbouring lands, it passed
under the dominion, first of Odoacer and then of
Theodoric, and it was the first place which was won
back to the Empire in the wars of Justinian. Lost
again and won back again, it appears throughout
those wars as the chief point of embarcation for the
Imperial armies on their voyages to Italy. This was
the last century of its greatness; in the next century
the modern history of Illyria begins. The Slaves
were moving, and the Avars were moving with them.
Salona fell into the hands of these last barbarians; it
was ruined and pillaged, and sank to the state in
which it has remained till our own time. Since the
seventh century Salona has ceased to rank among the
cities of the earth, but the house which had been
raised by its greatest citizen stood ready hard by to
supply a shelter to some at least of its homeless inhabitants.
Things were wholly turned about on the
bay of Salona and on the neighbouring peninsula.
Down to the days of Heraclius, Salona had been a
great city, with the vastest house that one man ever
reared standing useless in its neighbourhood. From
his day onwards the house grew into a city, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
city became a petty village, where, of all the places
along that historic coast, the traveller finds least to
disturb him in the pious contemplation of ruins. The
only danger is that his meditations may be broken in
upon by sellers of coins and scraps of all ages, dates,
and values. Coins at Salona hardly need the process
once known at the Mercian Dorchester as "going
a-Cæsaring." Cæsars seem to be picked up from
under and off the ground with much less trouble than
hunting for truffles. And even he who is no professed
numismatist or collector of gems will be pleased to
give a few <i>soldi</i>, perhaps even for a very clear image
and superscription of "Constantinus Junior Nob[ilissimus]
C[æsar]," much more for any image and
superscription of Jovius himself. It may have neither
rarity nor value in the eyes of the numismatically
learned; but it is something to carry away from
Salona itself the head of the foremost local worthy
in Salona's long annals.</p>

<h3>TRAÜ.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1877&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The visitor to Spalato and Salona should, if possible,
not fail to pay a visit to Traü. To most readers the
very name will doubtless be strange. Yet Tragurium
is an old city, a city old enough to be named by
Polybios, to say nothing of later Greek and Latin
writers. As in countless other cases, many readers
may have passed by the name without any notice at
all; others may have turned to the map, and, having
once found Tragurium, may have presently forgotten
that Tragurium was anywhere recorded. The case may
be different with those who carry on their studies so
far as to have dealings with the Imperial topographer.
In his pages the name of the city has got lengthened
into <span class="greek" title="Tetrangourion">&#932;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, and we are told that it was so
called <span class="greek" title="dia to einai auto mikron dikên angouriou">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;
</span>. We are
not ashamed to confess that the word <span class="greek" title="angouriou">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</span> gave us
no meaning whatever, and that we had to turn to our
dictionary to find that <span class="greek" title="angourion">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> means a water-melon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
But where the point of likeness is between the town
of Traü and a water-melon, and why the name should
have been lengthened, so as to suggest, if anything,
the notion of four water-melons, we are as much in
the dark as before. Those therefore who have made acquaintance
with the city in the shape of <span class="greek" title="Tetrangourion">&#932;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>
will have a chance of keeping it in their minds. But
with those who light only either on Tragurium or on
Traü, it will most likely happen as most commonly
happens with places which play no great part in
general history. The name passes away as a mere
name, till something happens to clothe it with a
special meaning. Salona the parent and Spalato the
child are names which never can become meaningless
to any one who has a decent knowledge of the history
of the world. But the name of Tragurium, Traü, will
probably always be purely meaningless, save to those
whom anything may have led to take a special interest
in Dalmatian matters. Tragurium has a history&mdash;no
place is without one&mdash;but its history is purely local
and Dalmatian. As far as one can venture to judge,
the great course of human affairs would have been
much the same if Tragurium had never become a city.
But there it stands, and, as it stands, its position, its
buildings, even its local history, combine to give it
no small interest. They make it no contemptible
appendage even to the famous spots in its immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
neighbourhood. Whatever was its origin, Tragurium
became a Roman town, and it was one of those places
on the Dalmatian coast which so long and steadily
clave to their allegiance to the Eastern Cæsars. As
the Byzantine power declined, the town was disputed
between the Kings of Hungary and the commonwealth
of Venice, and once at least it is said to have
felt the hand of Saracen plunderers. By each of the
Christian powers by which it was disputed it was won
and lost more than once, till it finally became Venetian
in 1420. Perhaps the point of greatest interest in
these dates is that Traü was a Hungarian possession at
the time of the building of its cathedral church in
the thirteenth century. It is said to have points of
likeness to other great Hungarian churches of the
same date.</p>

<p>The approach to Traü is a speaking commentary on
the state of things in days when no one but the lord
of a private fortress could be safe anywhere except
within a walled town. The road from Spalato to Traü
goes through Salona, through the heart of the ruined
city, as does the railway which the traveller may use
for part of his journey. The railway turns off;
the road keeps on alongside of the bay, with the
water on one side and the mountains on the other.
This road passes through the district of the <i>castelli</i>,
forts with surrounding villages, which various lords,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
spiritual and temporal, held of the Serene Republic
by a feudal tenure. Things were under the oligarchy
of Venice as they were under the democracy of Athens.
A private fortress within either city was unheard of;
neither Demos nor the Council of Ten would for a
moment have endured the existence of such towers as
we still see at Rome and at Bologna. But in the
outlying possessions of either commonwealth greater
licence was allowed. Alkibiadês had his private forts
in the Thracian Chersonêsos, and a string of Venetian
nobles and subjects of the Republic were allowed to
have their private forts along the shores of the bay of
Salona. The points which they occupied still remain
as small towns and villages, some of them with their
little havens on the lake-like sea, where the traveller
whom the railway has forsaken may haply light on a
small steamer to take him on. But none of those
among the <i>castelli</i> which we can ourselves speak of from
our own knowledge possess any architectural interest.
When at last we reach Traü, we see further how
needful it was, even in the case of a walled city, to
plant it in the position best suited for defence. Traü,
now at least, belongs to the class of island cities. At
the point where the large island of Bua comes nearest
to the mainland, a small island lies between it and the
shore, leaving only a narrow channel on each side,
spanned in each case by a bridge. But the language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
of the Emperor who likens the city to a water-melon
might suggest the idea that the site was once,
not insular, but peninsular. Constantine places his
<span class="greek" title="Tetrangourion">&#932;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> on a small island, but the small island
has a neck like a bridge which joins it to the mainland

somewhat contradictory way of speaking sounds as if,
as in the case of some other peninsular cities, a narrow
isthmus had been cut through. In the Peutinger
Table too, "Ragurio" is made distinctly peninsular.
Now at least the likeness of a bridge is exchanged for
the reality; the island is an island, and on this island
is built the main part of the city of Traü. A small
part only spreads itself on to Bua, where it begins to
climb the hills, though it goes up only a very little
way, by paths almost as rugged as though they were
in Montenegro. This outlying part, which contains
two churches, may pass as a suburb, a <i>Peraia</i>; for Bua
may reckon as a mainland when compared with the
neighbouring islet, and the real mainland of Dalmatia
seems to have been carefully avoided by the builders
of Tragurium. The view in Wheler would give no
one any idea of the size of Bua, any more than the
Peutinger Table would give any idea of its position.
But Wheler's view well brings out the relative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
positions of mainland, islet, and island, and it shows
how strongly Traü was fortified in his day. Such a
site as this was a valuable one in days when security
was the main object; but it hardly tends to prosperity
in modern times, and Tragurium must be reckoned
among the cities whose day is past. While Spalato is
putting on the likeness of a busy modern town, Traü
has nothing to show but its ancient memories.</p>

<p>Traü, as we now see it, is indeed an old-world place.
Even the new-made railway, which has appeared long
since our first visit, and which startles the quiet of
Salona and some of the <i>castelli</i>, keeps away from the
city of the four water-melons. Strangers come but
seldom, and they are remembered when they do come;
a visitor showing himself again after some years is
greeted in friendly guise as "one of the three Englishmen
with red beards." And the city looks like one of
the ends of the world. Owing to the peculiar position
of Traü, the fashion of narrow streets, common to all
the Dalmatian towns, is here carried to an extreme
point. Indeed the crooked alleys through which the
visitor has to thread his way, and the dark arches and
vaults under which he has to pass, give the place a
Turkish rather than a Venetian look. The explorer
of Traü might almost fancy himself at Trebinje. One
wonders how the Tragurians manage to live; it is only
on the quay and in the open place by the cathedral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
that there seems room to breathe. Yet, uninviting as
the streets of Traü are in their general effect, they
are far from being void of objects of interest. As
elsewhere in Dalmatia, we ever and anon light on
ornamental doorways and windows. In Traü some of
these show better forms than those of the familiar
Venetian Gothic; one or two windows are in style,
whatever they may be in date, genuine Romanesque.
Of the Venetian defences some considerable portions
remain; close by the water, at the south-western point
of the smaller island, is a castle bearing the badge
of Saint Mark, whose chief feature is a tower of irregular
octagonal shape, singularly and ingeniously
vaulted within. Of civic buildings the chief is the
Venetian <i>loggia</i>, now dirty and uncared for. But it
still keeps at its east end what at first sight seems
like an altar, dedicated, not to the Evangelist but to
his lion, but which really marks the judgment-seat of
the representative of the Republic in Traü. The
building was repaired over and over again, the last
renovation dating early in the seventeenth century;
but it keeps a colonnade, which, whenever it was put
together, was put together out of materials of far
earlier date. Some of the capitals seem to be late;
but there is one of true Corinthian form, which seems
closely akin to those in Diocletian's peristyle; another
capital is covered with rich foliage of a type rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Byzantine than classical. And on either side of the
<i>loggia</i>, forming a strange contrast to one another, one
of them utterly hidden from view, the other proclaiming
itself as the main ornament of the town, stand the
two most important ecclesiastical buildings of Traü.</p>

<p class="caption">CATHEDRAL, TRAÜ.</p>
</div>

<p>The chief architectural ornament of the city is undoubtedly
the formerly cathedral, now only collegiate,
church. This is a work of the thirteenth century,
with a stately bell-tower of the fourteenth or fifteenth.
But the tower of Traü is no detached campanile, such
as we have seen at Zara and Spalato. It forms part of
the building; it occupies its north-western corner, and
was designed to be one of a pair, after the usage of
more northern lands. The inscription on the southern
doorway gives 1215 as its date; one on the great
western doorway names 1240, and adds the name of
Raduanus as its artist. Looked at from the outside,
the work is of the best and most finished kind of
Italian Romanesque; and we have here, what is by no
means uncommon in Dalmatia, an example of the late
retention of the forms of that admirable style. The
tower palpably belongs to a later date, as it shows the
distinct forms of the Venetian Gothic, though, as
usual in Dalmatia, in a not unpleasing form. Eitelberger
quotes an inscription which gives the date as
1321, while in his text he speaks of it as 1421, just
after the Venetian capture of the town. And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
course of Dalmatian architecture is so capricious,
forms are found at dates when one would so little have
looked for them, that we really cannot undertake to
decide between the two. The inside of the church is
striking, with its round arches resting on massive
square piers of German rather than Italian character,
and with its clerestory and vault, in which the round
and pointed arch are struggling for the mastery.
By a freak almost more unaccountable than the red
rags of Zara, the piers have very lately been taught
to discharge the perhaps useful, but rather incongruous,
function of a catalogue of the bishops of Traü, bishops
whose succession has come to an end. The pulpit,
the stalls, and other fittings, are also striking in many
ways, and the triapsidal east end shows us a rather
simple Romanesque style in all its purity. But the
glory of Traü is at the other end. The stately portico
veils the still more stately western doorway, in which,
if the purity of the architectural style is somewhat
forsaken, we forgive it for the richness and variety of
its sculpture. The scriptural scenes in the tympanum,
the animal forms, the statues of Adam and Eve, the
crouching turbaned figures, the strange blending together
of sculpture and architectural forms, make
together a wonderful whole, none the less wonderful
because it is clear that everything is not exactly in its
right place, but that there has been a change or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
removal of some kind at some time. The details of
this splendid doorway, and of the church in general,
must be studied in the elaborate memoir of Eitelberger,
which, with its illustrations, goes further than
most memoirs of the kind to make the building really
intelligible at a distance. The turbaned figures are
far older than the appearance of the Ottoman in the
neighbourhood of Traü, or indeed in any part of
Europe. Are they Saracens whose forms record the
memories of some returning Crusader? Or are we to
believe that the Morlacchi used the turban as their
head-dress before the Ottoman came?</p>

<p>But the <i>duomo</i> is not all that Traü has to show in
the way of churches. On the other side of the
Venetian loggia stands, hidden among other buildings,
a church which is in its way of equal interest with
its greater neighbour, which certainly shows us a
purer form of Romanesque. This is the little desecrated
church of Saint Martin, now called Saint
Barbara, one of those domical buildings on a small
scale of which we have seen other varieties at Zara and
at Spalato. Its height and the tall stilts on its columns
would, if the building were cleared out, make it one
of the most striking instances of its style and scale.
Nearer to the water, south-east from the cathedral,
is another small Romanesque church, almost as
striking without as Saint Barbara is within. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
the small church of Saint John Baptist, which, except
that it has a square east end, might pass for an almost
typical Romanesque church on a small scale. Nearly
opposite to Saint Barbara is the most striking house in
Traü, with an open galleried court; and not very far
off, hidden in the narrow streets, is the Benedictine
monastery of Saint Nicolas, the foundation of the
local saint John Orsini in 1064. The points to be
noticed are not in the church but in the adjoining
buildings. There, besides some pretty Venetian windows
and doorways, is an arcade which looks as if it
were of genuine Romanesque date, though perhaps
hardly so old as the saint himself. A walk outside
the walls in the direction of the Venetian castle leads
to other churches, one of which, attached to a house
of Dominican nuns, surprises the visitor, like the
ruined chapel of the Gaetani by the tomb of Cæcilia
Metella, by its almost English look. A few hours
may well be spent in examining the antiquities of
this strange little island city, and in taking in the
varied views of land and sea which are to be had
alike from the lofty bell-tower and from the higher
ground on Bua. The journey back again shows us
objects which have become familiar to us, but which
are now seen in a reverse order. We mark the ever
shifting outlines of the hills, the islands and the bay
which they surround, the ruins of fallen Salona, Clissa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
on its peak, the stream of Giadro, the aqueduct of
Diocletian, till we again mount and descend the little
hill on the neck of the isthmus, and find ourselves
once more under the shadow of the palace-walls of
Spalato and of the bell-tower which soars so proudly
over them.

<p>As Spalato must be looked on as the great object
of a Dalmatian voyage, it may also be looked on as
its centre. After Spalato the coast scenery changes
its character in a marked way. Hitherto hills, comparatively
low and utterly barren, come down straight
to the sea, while the higher mountains are seen only
farther inland. From this point the great mountains
themselves come nearer to the water. We are thus
reminded of the change in the political boundary,
how from this point the Hadriatic territory of Austria
and of Christendom becomes narrower and narrower,
till we reach the stage when the old dominion of
Ragusa becomes a mere fringe between the sea and
the Turk, fenced in from the former land of Saint
Mark by the two points at either end where the less
dangerous infidel was allowed to spread himself to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
actual sea-board. But as the mountains come nearer
to the sea, a fringe of cultivation, narrower or wider,
now spreads itself between them and the water. Small
towns and villages, detached houses, land tilled with
the vine and the olive, now skirt the bases of the
mountains, in marked contrast to the mere stony hills
of the earlier part of the voyage. The islands too
among whose narrow channels we have to make our
way change their character also. After Spalato, instead
of mere uninhabited rocks, we come to islands
of greater size, some of them thirty or forty miles
long, islands several of which have a distinct place
in history, islands containing towns and cities, and
which are still seats of industry and cultivation.
These are the islands which give such a marked
character to the map of this part of the Hadriatic,
and they form the most marked feature in the fourth
day's voyage of the course from Trieste to Cattaro.
The endless islands which we have seen along the
northern part of the Dalmatian shore, bare and uninhabited
rocks as many of them are, are without
history. Some of the Croatian islands indeed have
somewhat of a history; but with these we are not
dealing; the barren archipelago of Zara could never
have had any tale to tell. First we pass through the
channel which divides the mainland from the large
island of Brazza, distinguished at a glance by its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
solid shape from its endless long and narrow fellows.
Dreary and rocky as it seems, it is the most populous
and industrious of the group, and at one point of its
coast, San Pietro, the steamer makes a short halt.
So it does at the picturesque little port of Almissa
on the mainland, a nest of houses and trees at the
mountain's foot, standing so invitingly as to make
the traveller wish for a longer sojourn. Then comes
Makarska, where we are allowed a short glimpse of
the little hill-side town, smaller and more Dalmatian
than any that we have yet seen. Presently we plunge
into the full intricacies of the Dalmatian seas. We
pass through the narrow channel which parts the
mainland from the eastern promontory of the long,
slender island of Lesina&mdash;the <i>awl</i>. Here we come
within old Hellenic memories. We are now within
the full range of Greek colonization, though of Greek
colonization only in its latest stage. Issa, now Lissa,
Black Korkyra, now Curzola, amongst the islands,
and Epidauros on the mainland, were all of them
undoubted Greek settlements. But Issa and Pharos,
the only ones to which we can fix a positive date,
were colonized only in the first half of the fourth
century, and Dionysios of Syracuse had a hand in
their colonization. Lesina is Pharos, the ancient
colony of the Ægæan Paros, whose name still lives
on Slavonic lips in the shape of <i>Far</i> or <i>Hvar</i>. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
plays a considerable part in the history of Polybios,
as the island of that Dêmêtrios whose crooked policy
formed an important element in the affairs of mankind
in the days when Greek and Roman history began to
flow together into one stream. These islands form
one of the highways by which Rome advanced to the
possession of Illyricum, Macedonia, and Greece. But
we see neither the ancient nor the modern city,
neither Pharos nor Lesina; we merely skirt the island
to find ourselves in the channel of Narenta. That
name suggests yet another pirate power, later than
that of Tenta and Dêmêtrios, that power of the old
Pagania against which Venice, in her early days, had
to wage so hard a struggle. We seem to be pressing
on between the mainland and a long, slender, mountainous
island; but our course suddenly turns; the
seeming island is no other than the long peninsula
of Sabioncello, a peninsula not Venetian but Ragusan.
We get merely a glimpse down the gulf, at the end of
which Turkish Klek once divided the possessions of
the two maritime commonwealths, and still, nominally
at least, breaks the continuity of Austrian dominion.
But, if the peninsula was Ragusan, a narrow channel
only parts it from an island which was a chief seat of
the power of the rival city. We skirt the western
horn of Sabioncello, and another turn leads us through
the channel&mdash;narrower than any through which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
have passed&mdash;which divides it from Curzola, Black
Korkyra of old. We stop for a little while off the
island capital, the fortress of Curzola, which was to
the declining navy of Venice what Pola now is to
the rising navy of Austria. This channel passed, we
come to the last of the great islands. For miles and
miles we skirt the Ragusan island of Meleda, long,
slender, with its endless hills of no great height
standing up like the teeth of a saw&mdash;a true sierra in
miniature. Here volumes of scriptural controversy
are open to us. As we are not tossed up and down in
Hadria, but are floating along as on a lake or a river,
we muse on the claims which all local and some independent
authorities have set up for Illyrian Meleda,
as against Ph&oelig;nician Malta, to be the true seat of the
shipwreck of Saint Paul. But Meleda can have its
claims admitted only on the condition of being shut
out from Hellenic fellowship, even though its barbarians
were of a mood which led them to show no
little kindness to strangers. It is hard also to understand
how those who were making their way from
Meleda to any point of Italy could have any possible
business at Syracuse. At all events, with Meleda the
island history ends, though the island scenery does
not end as yet. Several islands, smaller than these
more famous ones, but not so small as they look on
the map, fringe the coast till we enter the haven of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Gravosa, the port of modern Ragusa, with its thickly
wooded shores, a marked contrast to the bleakness and
barrenness of so many other points of the Dalmatian
coast.</p>

<p>Ragusa, the city of argosies, the commonwealth
which so long was the rival of Venice and which
never stooped to be her subject, so thoroughly suggests
maritime enterprise by her very name, that we
are surprised to find that Ragusa herself has ceased
to be a port of any moment. Her mighty walls,
her castles, her more distant forts, still rise out of
the sea, and the mightier wall of mountains just
behind her still fence off her land, as the narrowest
rim of Christendom, from the land of the infidel
beyond. All this is as it was; modern military art
has added to the defences of Ragusa, but it has not
taken away her elder bulwarks. But her haven is
now of the very smallest, and admits only vessels of
the smallest size. The modern haven is at Gravosa,
and the road which Sir Gardner Wilkinson describes
as so well kept, but as useless because no carriages
went upon it, is still as good and more useful. At
this moment Ragusa bears the honourable character
of a city of refuge for the unhappy ones who seek
shelter under the government of a civilized state
from the barbarian rule beyond the mountains. Her
suburbs are crowded with women and children flying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
from the seat of war, for whom the charity both of
the state and of private persons is doing much, but
whose sufferings&mdash;as one who has seen them can bear
witness&mdash;cry for the sympathy and help of all who
have hearts and who have not invested in Turkish
bonds. As we pass by and look on the city&mdash;no city
surely fronts the sea more proudly than Ragusa&mdash;as
we turn round to the island of La Croma, lying off
what was Ragusa's harbour, the island which suggests
the names of Richard of Poitou and of Maximilian of
Mexico&mdash;the scene is so peaceful and lovely, the warlike
defences look such mere things of the past, that
it is hard indeed to believe that, just beyond the
mountain barrier, warfare is going on in its bitterest
and yet its noblest form&mdash;the struggle of an oppressed
people to cast off the yoke of ages. This form of
speech may grate somewhat on the received phrases
of Western diplomacy; but, however we might be
bound to write in England, in Dalmatia&mdash;so close to
the facts&mdash;we may be allowed to write as all men in
Dalmatia think and speak. We pass La Croma, and
our time among the islands is over; no other that
can be called more than a mere rock meets us
between Ragusa and Cattaro. At last we enter the
loveliest of inlets of the sea, the <i>Bocche di Cattaro</i>. A
narrow strait leads us between points of land which
were once Ragusan on the west and Venetian to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
east, into the winding gulf, girded by mountains, and
now for nearly its whole extent fringed by towns,
villages, houses, cultivation in every form&mdash;a land
where the sublimity of the rugged mountain has
come into close partnership with the loveliness of the
smiling dwelling-places of man. As we pass through
the strait, a piece of barren mountain to the left
marks the second piece of territory where the Turk
was allowed to isolate the two commonwealths, and
where, in name, his dominion still reaches to the shore
of the lovely gulf. We pass on, as on the smoothest
of lakes, round mountain headlands, with their rich
fringe of life, by towns and villages, many of which
have their own local history both in earlier and later
times, till we reach the most distant of Dalmatian
cities, Cattaro at the innermost point of her own
unrivalled <i>Bocche</i>. Hemmed in between the mountains
and the sea&mdash;though it seems almost strange to
apply the word sea to the gentle waters of her harbour&mdash;with
the mountains again rising on the other
side, Cattaro seems indeed to be the end of its own
world. Yet in the days of Venetian greatness, Cattaro
was far indeed from being the last point of the
dominion of Saint Mark. Climb the heights above
the city, and the eye stretches far away along the
Albanian coast, a coast along which many a city
and island once bowed to the winged lion, till in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
fancy we track our course, as by stepping stones
along the sea, to distant Crete and to more distant
Cyprus.</p>

<p>Cattaro, the end of the outward journey, will also
be the beginning of the journey back again. The
little town, with its narrow paved streets, its little
piazze, still keeps up the same Venetian tradition as
elsewhere. And the walls of the fortress climbing far
up the mountain show how firm was the grasp of the
ruling city over its subjects. But at Cattaro and
throughout the Bocche another feature strikes us
which we do not see either at Spalato or at Ragusa.
The churches do not all belong to one denomination;
the Eastern, the Orthodox, Church, holds its own in
this corner of Venetian or Austrian rule at least as
firmly as its Latin rival. The fact is, what is forced
upon our notice at every step, that, the further we go
along this coast, the Italian element dies out and the
Slavonic element grows. It is so in language, in
dress, in everything. Zara, Spalato, Ragusa, Cattaro,
each city is less and less Italian according to its
geographical position. The inland country is, of
course, Slave throughout. But at Cattaro the Slave
element distinctly predominates, even in the town;
Italian can hardly be said to be more than the best
known among foreign languages. The pistol and
yataghan worn in the belt, a general costume essentially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the same as that of the Montenegrin, has gradually
been growing upon us; here in Cattaro it is
the rule, almost more than the rule. In short, the
Bocchese, the Montenegrin, the Turkish rayah of
Herzegovina, really differ in nothing but the difference
of their political destinies. They are members
of the same immediate family, whose fortunes have
led them in three different directions. Now the
religious tendency of the south-eastern Slaves, as is
only natural from their geographical position, has
always been towards the Eastern Church rather than
the Western, towards the New Rome rather than
towards the Old. Here, where the Slavonic element is
so distinctly the stronger, the religious developement
has taken its natural course, and the Orthodox population
in Cattaro and all the coasts thereof is always
a large minority, and in some places it actually
outnumbers the Latins.</p>

<p>We have professed to give only the impressions of
the outward voyage, though our account may have
here and there been influenced by later impressions
drawn from fuller observation on the way back. But
the way back, and the fuller knowledge gained in its
course, only brings out more strongly the intense
charm of Dalmatian coast and mountain scenery, fitly
united with the deep historic interest of cities which,
though they seem to form a world apart by themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
have played their part in the world's history none the
less. No one can visit Dalmatia once without a wish
that his first visit may not be his last; no one can
take a glimpse of any of her cities without the desire
that the glimpse may be only the forerunner of more
perfect knowledge.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We part from Spalato; by the time that we have
made two or three voyages in these seas, we shall find
that there are several ways of reaching and parting
from Spalato. We speak of course of ways by sea;
by land there is but one way, and that way leads only
to and from places at no great distance, and it does not
lead to or from any place in the direction in which we
are now bent. By sea the steamer takes two courses.
One keeps along the mainland, that which allows a
glimpse of the little towns of Almissa and Makarska,
both nestling by the water's edge at the mountain's
foot. Of these Almissa at least has an historical
interest. Here Saint Mark was no direct sovereign;
his lion, if we rightly remember, is nowhere to be
seen, a distinction which, along this whole line of
coast, Almissa alone shares with greater Ragusa. Was
it a commonwealth by itself, cradled on the channel of
Brazza like Gersau on the Lake of the Four Cantons?
Or was it the haven of the inland commonwealth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Polizza, which, like Gersau and a crowd of other
commonwealths, perished at the hands of their newborn
French sister for the unpardonable crime of being
old? But far more interesting is the other route of
the steamers, that which leads us among the greater
islands. Here, as soon as we pass Spalato, as soon as
we pass the greatest monument of the dominion of
Rome, we presently find ourselves in a manner within
the borders of Hellas. We pass between Brazza and
Solta, we skirt Lesina and think once more of its old
Parian memories. We look out on Lissa, where the
Hellenic name lives on with slighter change, but we
are more inclined to dwell on those later memories
which have made its name an unlucky one in our own
day, a far luckier one in the days of our grandfathers.
At last we make our first halt for study where a
narrow strait divides the mainland, itself all but an
island, from another ancient seat of Greek settlement,
the once renowned isle of Curzola.</p>

<p>Curzola&mdash;such is its familiar Italian form&mdash;is the
ancient Black Korkyra, and on Slavonic lips it still
keeps the elder name in the shape of <i>Kerker</i>. But
the sight of <span class="greek" title="hê melaina Korkura">&#7969; &#956;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#945; &#922;&#972;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;
</span> suggests a question of
the same kind as that which the visitor is driven to
ask on his first sight of Montenegro. How does a
mass of white limestone come to be called the Black
Mountain? Curzola can hardly be called a mass of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
white limestone; but the first glance shows nothing
specially black about it, nothing to make us choose
this epithet rather than any other to distinguish this
Hadriatic Korkyra from the more famous Korkyra
to the south. That some distinguishing epithet is
needed is shown by the fact that, not so very long
ago, a special correspondent of the <i>Times</i> took the
whole history of Corfu and transferred it bodily to
Curzola. The reason given for the name is the same
in Curzola and in Montenegro. The blackness both
of the island and of the mountain is the blackness
of the woods with which they are covered. True the
traveller from Cattaro to Tzetinje sees no woods,
black or otherwise; but he is told that the name
comes from thick woods on the other side of the
principality. So he is told that Black Korkyra was
called from its thick woods, its distinctive feature as
compared with the many bare islands in its neighbourhood.
But no black woods are now to be seen in
that part of the island which the traveller is most
likely to see anything of. There were such, he is
told; but they have been cut down on this side, while
on the other side they still flourish. As things are
now, Curzola is certainly less bare than most of its
fellows; but the impression which it gives us is, of the
two, rather that of a green island than of a black one.
It is not green in the sense of rich verdure, but such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
trees as show themselves give it a look rather green
than black. At any rate, the island looks both
low and well-covered, as compared with the lofty and
rocky mountains of the opposite peninsula of Sabioncello.
The two are at one point, and that a point
close by the town of Curzola, separated by a very
narrow strait. And the nearness of the two formed no
inconsiderable part of their history. There was a time
when Curzola must have been, before all things, a
standing menace to Sabioncello, and to the state of
which Sabioncello formed an outpost. Sabioncello,
the long, narrow, stony peninsula, all backbone and
nothing else, formed part of the dominions of the
commonwealth of Ragusa. Curzola was for three
centuries and a half a stronghold of that other commonwealth
which Ragusa so dreaded that she preferred
the Turk as her neighbour. Nowhere does the
winged lion meet us more often or more prominently
than on the towers and over the gates of Curzola.
And no wonder; for Curzola was the choice seat of
Venetian power in these waters, her strong arsenal,
the place for the building of her galleys. If Aigina
was the eyesore of Peiraieus, Curzola must have been
yet more truly the eyesore of Sabioncello.</p>

<p>It is only of what must have been the special
eyesore of its Ragusan neighbours, of the fortified
town of Curzola and of a few points in its near neighbourhood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
that we can now speak. Curzola is one of
the larger Dalmatian islands; and it is an island of
some zoological interest. It is one of the few spots
in Europe where the jackal still lingers. Perhaps
there is no other, but, as we have heard rumours of
like phænomenon in Epeiros, a decided negative is
dangerous. We believe that, according to the best
scientific opinion, "lingered" is the right word. The
jackal is not an importation from anywhere else into
Curzola; he is an old inhabitant of Europe, who has
kept his ground in Curzola after he has been driven
out of other places. But he who gives such time as
the steamer allows him in the island to the antiquities
of the town of Curzola need cherish no hope or fear of
meeting jackals. He might as soon expect to meet
with a horse. For, true child of Venice, Curzola
knows neither horse nor carriage. Horses and carriages
are not prominent features in any of the Dalmatian
towns; but they may be seen here and there. They
are faintly tolerated within the walls of Ragusa, and
we have certainly seen a cart in the streets of Zara.
But at Curzola they are as impossible as at Venice
itself, though not for the same reason. Curzola does
not float upon the waters; it soars above them. The
Knidian emigrants chose the site of their town in the
true spirit of Greek colonists. It is such another site
as the Sicilian Naxos, as the Epidauros of the Hadriatic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
as Zara too and Parenzo, though Zara and
Parenzo can lay no claim to a Greek foundation.
The town occupies a peninsula, which is joined to the
main body of the island by a narrow isthmus. The
positive elevation is slight, but the slope close to the
water on each side is steep. From the narrow ridge
where stands the once cathedral church, the streets
run down on each side, narrow and steep, for the most
part ascended by steps. The horses of the wave are
the only steeds for the men of Black Korkyra, and
those steeds they have at all times managed with
much skill. The seafaring habits of the people take
off in some measure from the picturesque effect of the
place. There is much less to be seen, among men at
least, of local costume at Curzola than at other Dalmatian
towns. We miss the Morlacchian turbans which
become familiar at Spalato; we miss the Montenegrin
coats of the brave <i>Bocchesi</i>, which fill the streets of
Cattaro, not without a meaning. Seafaring folk are
apt to wear the dress of their calling rather than that
of their race, and the island city cannot be made such
a centre for a large rural population as the cities on
the mainland. But, if the men to be seen at Curzola
are less picturesque than the men to be seen at
Spalato or Ragusa, their dwellings make up for the
lack. Curzola is a perfect specimen of a Venetian
town. It is singular how utterly everything earlier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
than the final Venetian occupation of 1420 has passed
away. The Greek colonist has left no sign of himself
but the site. Of Roman, of earlier mediæval, times
there is nothing to be seen beyond an inscription or
two, one of which, a fragment worked into the pavement
of one of the steep streets, records the connexion
which once was between Curzola and Hungary. With
præ-Venetian inscriptions we may class one which is
post-Venetian, and which records another form of
foreign dominion, one which may be classed with that
of Lewis the Great as at least better than those which
went between them. From 1813 to 1815&mdash;a time
memorable at Curzola as well as at Cattaro&mdash;the
island was under English rule, and the time of
English rule was looked on as a time of freedom,
compared with French rule before or with Austrian
rule both before and after. It is not only that an
official inscription speaks of the island as "libertate
fruens" at the moment when the connexion was
severed; we believe that we are justified in saying
that those two years live in Black-Korkyraian memory
as the one time for many ages when the people of
Black Korkyra were let alone.</p>

<p>The formerly cathedral church is the only building
in the town of Curzola which suggests any thought
that it can be older than 1420. Documentary evidence,
we believe, is scanty, and contains no mention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
of the church earlier than the thirteenth century.
In England we should at first sight be tempted to
assign the internal arcades to the latter days of the
twelfth; but the long retention of earlier forms which
is so characteristic of the architecture of this whole
region makes it quite possible that they may be no
earlier than the Venetian times to which we must
certainly attribute the west front. Setting aside a
later addition to the north, which is no improvement,
this little <i>duomo</i> consists of a nave and aisles of five
bays, ending in three round apses. Five bays we say,
though on the north side there are only four arches;
for the tower occupies one at the west end. The
inner arcades and the west doorway are worthy of real
study, as contributions to the stock of what is at any
rate singular in architecture; indeed a more honourable
word might fairly be used. The arcades consist
of plain pointed arches rising from columns with richly
carved capitals, and, like so many columns of all ages
in this region, with tongues of foliage at their bases.
Above is a small triforium, a pair of round arches
over each bay; above that is a clerestory of windows
which within seem to be square, but which outside
are found to be broad pointed lancets with their
heads cut off. In England or France such a composition
as this would certainly, at the first sight of
its general effect, be set down as belonging to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
time of transition between Romanesque and Gothic,
to the days of Richard of Poitou and Philip Augustus.
And the proportions are just as good as they would
be in England or France; there is not a trace of
that love of ungainly sprawling arches which ruins
half the so-called Gothic churches of Italy. But,
when we look at the capitals, we begin to doubt.
They are singularly rich and fine; but they are
not rich and fine according to any received pattern.
They are eminently not classical; they have nothing
more than that faint Corinthian stamp which no
floriated capital seems able quite to throw away;
they do not come anything like so near to the
original model as the capitals at Canterbury, at Sens,
or even at Lisieux. But neither do they approach to
any of the received Romanesque or Byzantine types,
nor have they a trace of the freedom which belongs
to the English foliage of days only a little later.
They are more like, though still not very much like,
our foliage of the fourteenth century; there is a
massiveness about them, a kind of cleaving to the
shape of the block, which after all has something
Byzantine about it. Those on the north side have
figures wrought among the foliage; the four responds
have the four evangelistic symbols. Here then we
cannot fail to find the lion of Saint Mark, but we
find him only in his place as one of a company of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
four. Would the devotion of the Most Serene Republic
have allowed its patron anywhere so lowly a
place as this to occupy? Otherwise the character of
the capitals, which extends to the small shafts in
the triforium, might tempt us to assign a far later
date to these columns and arches than their general
effect would suggest. But at all events they are
thoroughly mediæval; there is not the faintest trace
of <i>Renaissance</i> about them.</p>

<p>Outside the church, the usual mixed character of
the district comes out more strongly. The addition
to the north, and the tower worked in instead of
standing detached, go far to spoil what would otherwise
be a simple and well-proportioned Italian front.
Both the round window&mdash;of course there is a round
window&mdash;and the great doorway are worthy of notice.
The window is not a mere wheel; the diverging lines
run off into real tracery, such as we might see in
either England or France. The doorway is a curious
example of the way in which for a long time in
these regions, the square head, the round arch, and
the pointed arch, were for some purposes used almost
indifferently. The tradition of the square-headed
doorway with the arched tympanum over it never
died out. We may believe that the mighty gateways
and doorways of Diocletian's palace set the general
model for all ages. But when the pointed arch came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
in, the tympanum might be as well pointed as round.
Sometimes the pointed tympanum crowns a thoroughly
round-headed doorway, and is itself crowned
with a square spandril, looking wonderfully like a
piece of English Perpendicular. In the west doorway
at Curzola things do not go quite to such lengths as
this; but they go a good way. The square doorway
is crowned by a pointed tympanum, containing the
figure of a bishop; over that again is a kind of
canopy. This is formed of a round arch, springing
from a pair of lions supported on projections such as
those which are constantly used, specially at Curzola,
for the support of balconies. The lions which in
many places would have supported the columns of
the doorway seem, though wingless, to have flown
up to this higher post. For here the doorway has
nothing to be called columns, nothing but small
shafts, twisted and otherwise, continued in the mouldings
of the arch. The cornice under the low gable
is very rich; the tower is of no great account, except
the parapet, and the octagon and cupola which crown
it, a rich and graceful piece of work of that better
kind of <i>Renaissance</i> which we claim as really Romanesque.</p>

<p>In the general view of the town from the sea this
tower counts for more than it does when we come
close up to it in the nearest approach to a <i>piazza</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
which Curzola can boast. It is the crown of the
whole mass of buildings rising from the water. At
Curzola the fortifications are far more to the taste of
the antiquary than they are at Ragusa; they fence
things round at the bottom, instead of hiding everything
from the top. We may shut our eyes to a
modern fort or two on the hills; the walls of the town
itself, where they are left, are picturesque mediæval
walls broken by round towers, on some of which the
winged lion does not fail to show himself. He presides
again over a <i>loggia</i> by the seashore, one of those
buildings with nondescript columns, which may be
of any date, which most likely are of very late date,
but which, because they are simply straightforward
and sensible, are pleasing, whatever may be their date.
Here they simply support a wooden roof, without
either arch or entablature. And while we are seated
under the lion in the <i>loggia</i>, we may look down at
another lion in a sculptured fragment by the shore,
in company with a female half-figure, something of
the nature of a siren, Nereid, or mermaid, who seems
an odd yoke-fellow for the Evangelist. He seems
more in his natural place over the gate by which we
shall most likely enter the town, a gate of 1643,
itself square-headed, but with pointed vaulting within.
Its inscriptions do not fail to commemorate the Trojan
Antênor as founder of Black Korkyra, along with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
a more modern ruler, the Venetian John-Baptist
Grimani. To the right hand, curiosity is raised by
a series of inscriptions which have been carefully
scratched out. About them there are many guesses
and many traditions. One cannot help thinking that
the deed was more likely to be done by the French
than by the Austrian intruder. To scratch out an
inscription is a foolish and barbarous act; but it
implies an understanding of its meaning and a misapplied
kind of vigour, which, of the two stolen eagles,
was more likely to flourish under the single-headed
one. The double-headed pretender, by the way,
though he is seen rather too often in these parts, is
seldom wrought in such lasting materials as Saint
Mark's lion. So, when the good time comes, the
stolen badge of Empire may, at Curzola as at Venice
and Verona, pass away and be no more seen, without
any destruction of monuments, old or new.</p>

<p>We are now fairly in the town. The best way to
see Curzola thoroughly is for the traveller to make
his way how he will to the ridge of the peninsula, and
then systematically to visit the steep and narrow
streets, going in regular order down one and up
another. There is not one which does not contain
some bit of domestic architecture which is well worth
looking at. But he should first walk along the ridge
itself from the gate by the isthmus to the point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
where the ground begins to slope to the sea opposite
Sabioncello. Hard by the gate is the town-hall,
<i>Obcina</i>, as it is now marked in the native speech.
The mixed style&mdash;most likely of the seventeenth
century&mdash;of these parts comes out here in its fulness.
Columns and round arches which would satisfy any
reasonable Romanesque ideal, support square windows
which are relieved from ugliness by a slight moulding,
the dentel&mdash;akin to our Romanesque billet&mdash;which is
seen everywhere. But in a projecting building, which
is clearly of a piece with the rest, columns with nondescript
capitals support pointed arches. Opposite
to the town-hall is one of the smaller churches, most
of which are of but little importance. This one bears
the name of Saint Michael, and is said to have
formerly been dedicated to Orthodox worship. It
shows however no sign of such use, unless we are to
count the presence of a little cupola over the altar.
We pass along the ridge, by a house where the projection
for balconies, so abundant everywhere, puts
on a specially artistic shape, being wrought into
various forms, human and animal. Opposite the
cathedral the houses display some characteristic
forms of the local style, and we get more fully
familiar with them, as we plunge into the steep
streets, following the regular order which has been
already prescribed. Some graceful scrap meets us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
at every step; the pity is that the streets are so
narrow that it needs some straining of the neck to
see those windows which are set at all high in the
walls. For it is chiefly windows which we light upon:
very little care seems to have been bestowed on the
doorways. A square or segmental-headed doorway,
with no attempt at ornament, was thought quite
enough for a house for whose windows the finest work
of the style was not deemed too good. Indeed the
contrasts are so odd that, in the finest house in
Curzola, in one of the streets leading down eastward
from the cathedral, a central story for which
<i>magnificent</i> would not be too strong a word is placed
between these simple doorways below and no less
simple square-headed windows above. This is one
of the few houses in Curzola where the windows are
double or triple divided by shafts. Most of the
windows are of a single light, with a pointed, an ogee,
or even a round head, but always, we think, with the
eminently Venetian trefoil, and with the jambs treated
as a kind of pilaster. With windows of this kind the
town of Curzola is thick-set in every quarter. We
may be sure that there is nothing older than the
Venetian occupation, and that most of the houses are
of quite late date, of the sixteenth and even the
seventeenth century. The Venetian style clave to
mediæval forms of window long after the <i>Renaissance</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
had fully set in in everything else. And for an
obvious reason; whatever attractions the <i>Renaissance</i>
might have from any other point of view, in the
matter of windows at least it hopelessly failed. In
the streets of Curzola therefore we meet with an
endless store of windows, but with little else. Yet
here and there there are other details. The visitor
will certainly be sent to see a door-knocker in a
house in one of the streets on the western slope.
There Daniel between two lions is represented in fine
bronze work. And some Venetian effigies, which
would doubtless prove something for local history,
may be seen in the same court. Of the houses in
Curzola not a few are roofless; not a few have their
rich windows blocked; not a few stand open for the
visitor to see their simple inside arrangements. The
town can still make some show on a day of festival;
but it is plain that the wealth and life of Curzola
passed away when it ceased to be the arsenal of
Venice. And poverty has one incidental advantage;
it lets things fall to ruin, but it does not improve or
restore.</p>

<p>Two monasteries may be seen within an easy
distance of the town. That of Saint Nicolas, approached
by a short walk along the shore to the
north-west, makes rather an imposing feature in the
general view from the sea; but it is disappointing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
when we come near. Yet it illustrates some of the
local tendencies; a very late building, as it clearly is,
it still keeps some traces of earlier ideas. Two equal
bodies, each with a pointed barrel-vault, might remind
us of some districts of our own island, and, with
nothing else that can be called mediæval detail, the
round window does not fail to appear. The other
monastery, best known as the <i>Badia</i>, once a house of
Benedictines, afterwards of Franciscans, stands on a
separate island, approached by a pleasant sail. The
church has not much more to show than the other;
but it too illustrates the prevalent mixture of styles
which comes out very instructively in the cloister.
This bears date 1477, as appears from an inscription
over one of its doors. But this doorway is flat-headed
and has lost all mediæval character, while the cloister
itself is a graceful design with columns and trefoil
arches, which in other lands one would attribute to a
much earlier date. The library contains some early
printed books and some Greek manuscripts, none
seemingly of any great intrinsic value. A manuscript
of Dionysios Periêgêtês is described as the
property of the Korkyraian Nicolas and his friends.
(<span class="greek" title="Nikolaou Kerkyraiou kai tôn philôn.">&#925;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#940;&#959;&#965; &#922;&#949;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#966;&#943;&#955;&#969;&#957;. </span>) Nicolas had
a surname, but unluckily it has passed away from our
memory and from our notes. But the local description
which he has given of himself makes us ask,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Did the book come from Corfu, or did any citizen
of Black Korkyra think it had a learned look so to
describe himself?</p>

<p>On the staircase of the little inn at Curzola still
hangs a print of the taking of the arsenal of Venice
by the patriots of 1848. Strange that no Imperial,
Royal, and Apostolic official has taken away so
speaking a memorial of a deed which those who
commemorate it would doubtless be glad to follow.</p>

<h3>RAGUSA.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1877&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The voyage onward from Curzola will lead, as its
next natural stopping-place, to Ragusa. At Curzola,
or before he reaches Curzola, the traveller will have
made acquaintance with what was once the territory
of the Ragusan commonwealth, in the shape of the
long peninsula of Sabioncello. He will have seen
how all the winged lions of Curzola look out so
threateningly towards the narrow tongue of land which
bowed to Saint Blaise and not to Saint Mark. He
will pass by Meleda, that one among the larger islands
which obeyed Ragusan and not Venetian rule. After
Meleda the islands cease to be the most important
features in the geography or in the prospect. They
end, so far as they give any character to the scene, in
the group which lies off the mouth of the inlet of
Gravosa and Ombla, the ordinary path to Ragusa.
But he who would really take in the peculiar position
of Ragusa will do well to pass by the city on his outward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
voyage, to go on to Cattaro, and to take Ragusa
on the way back. The wisdom of so doing springs
directly out of the history of the city. The haven,
which is said&mdash;and we have no better derivation to
suggest&mdash;to have given its name to <i>argosies</i>, could
certainly not give shelter to a modern argosy. Nothing
but smaller craft now make their way to Ragusa
herself; steamers and everything else stop at the port
of Gravosa. It has been only quite lately, long since
the earlier visits which gave birth to the present
sketches, that Ragusan enterprise has so far again
awakened as to send a single steamer at long intervals
from the true Ragusan haven to Trieste. He therefore
who visits Ragusa on his outward voyage has to
land at Gravosa and to make his way to Ragusa by
land. He thus loses the first sight of the city from
the sea which he has had at Zara and Spalato, and
which at Ragusa is, setting special associations aside,
even more striking than at Zara and Spalato. Before
he sees Ragusa from the water, as Ragusa was made to
be seen, he has already made acquaintance with the
city in a more prosaic fashion. He will not indeed
have had his temper soured by the inconveniences
which Sir Gardner Wilkinson had to put up with more
than thirty years ago. There is no more delay at the
gate of Ragusa, there is no more difficulty in finding
a carriage to take the traveller from Gravosa to Ragusa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
than there is in the most frequented regions of the
West. Still, in such a case, the traveller sees Ragusa
for the first time from the land, and Ragusa of all
places ought to be seen for the first time from the
sea. Seen in this way, the general effect of Ragusa is
certainly more striking than that of any other Dalmatian
city; and it is so in some measure because the
effect of Ragusa, whether looked at with the bodily
eye or seen in the pages of its history, is above all
things a general effect. There is not, as there is at
Zara and at Spalato, any particular moment in the
history of the city, any particular object in the city
itself, which stands out prominently above all others.
We draw near to Zara, and say, "There is the city that
was stormed by the Crusaders," and, though we find
much at Zara to awaken interest on other grounds, the
crusading siege still remains the first thing. We draw
near to Spalato; we see the palace and the campanile,
and round the palace and the campanile everything
gathers. We draw near to Ragusa; the eye is struck
by no such prominent object; the memory seizes on
no such prominent fact. But there is Ragusa; there
is the one spot along that whole coast from the Croatian
border to Cape Tainaros itself, which never came under
the dominion either of the Venetian or of the Turk.
Ragusa will be found at different times standing in
something like a tributary or dependent relation to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
both those powers, but it never was actually incorporated
with the dominions of either. In this Ragusa
stands alone among the cities of the whole coast,
Dalmatian, Albanian, and Greek. Among all the endless
confusions and fluctuations of power in those
regions, Ragusa stands alone as having ever kept its
place, always as a separate, commonly as an independent,
commonwealth. It lived on from the break-up
of the Byzantine power on those coasts till the
day when the elder Buonaparte, in the mere caprice
of tyranny, without provocation of any kind, declared
one day that the Republic of Ragusa had ceased to
exist. This is the history of Ragusa, a history whose
general effect is as striking as any history can be. It
is a history too which, if we dig into its minute details,
is full of exciting incidents, but not of incidents which,
like the one incident in the history of Zara, stand out
in the general history of Europe. There is, to be sure,
one incident in Ragusan history which may claim
some attention at the hands of Englishmen, and ought
to claim more at the hands of Poitevins. Count
Richard of Poitou, who was also by a kind of accident
King of England, and who in the course of his reign
paid England two very short visits, paid also a visit to
Ragusa which was perhaps still shorter. But this
again is an incident of mere curiosity. The homeward
voyage and captivity of Richard had some effect on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
the general affairs of the world; his special visit to
Ragusa affected only the local affairs of Ragusa.
Ragusan history then may either be taken in at a
glance, and a most striking glance it is; or else it
may be studied with the minute zeal of a local antiquary.
There is no intermediate point from which
it can be looked at. In the general history of Europe
Ragusa stands out, as the city itself stands out to the
eye of the traveller, as that one among the famous
cities of the Dalmatian and Albanian coast where the
Lion of Saint Mark is not to be seen.</p>

<p>As is the history, so is the general effect. As we
sail past Ragusa, as we look at the city from any of
the several points which the voyage opens to us, we
say at once, Here is one of the most striking sights of
our whole voyage; but we cannot at once point our
finger to any one specially striking object. There are
good campaniles, but there is nothing very special
about them; there are castles and towers in abundance,
but each by itself on any other site would be
passed by without any special remark. What does
call for special remark and special admiration is the
city itself, at once rising from the sea and fenced in
from the sea by its lofty walls. It is the shore, with its
rocks and its small inlets, each rock seized on as the
site of a fortress. It is the background of hills, forming
themselves a natural rampart, but with the artificial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
defences carried up and along them to their very crest.
Here we are not tempted, as we are tempted at some
points of our voyage, to forget that our voyage is one
by sea, and to fancy that we are floating gently on
some Swiss or Italian lake. Ragusa does not stand on
a deep inlet like Cattaro, on a bay like Spalato, on a
peninsula like Zara, fenced in by islands on one side
and by the opposite shore of its haven on the other.
Ragusa does indeed stand on a peninsula, but it is a
peninsula of quite another kind; a peninsula of hills
and rocks and inlets, offering a bold front to the full
force of the open sea. One island indeed, La Croma,
lies like a guard-ship anchored in front of the city,
but we feel that La Croma is strictly an island of the
sea. The islands of the more northern coast form as it
were a wall to shelter the coast itself. And such a
function seems specially to be laid upon the small
islands which lie off the mouth of Ragusa's modern
haven at Gravosa. Covered indeed as they are with
modern fortifications, it is not merely in a figure that
it is laid upon them. But La Croma fills no such
function. The city of argosies boldly fronts the sea
on which her argosies were to sail, and fiercely do the
waves of that sea sometimes dash upon her rocks.
Ragusa seems the type of a city which has to struggle
with the element on which her life is cast, while Venice
is the type of a city which has, in the sense of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
own yearly ceremony, brought that element wholly
under her dominion.</p>

<p>As we look up from the sea to the mountains, we
feel yet more strongly how purely Ragusa was a city
of the sea. Venice was an inland power on that Italian
land off which she herself lay anchored. She might
pass for an inland power even on the Ragusan side of
the Hadriatic. The Dalmatian territory of Venice looks
on the map like a narrow strip; but, compared with
the Ragusan coast, the Venetian coast has a wide
Venetian mainland to the back of it. But Ragusa
lies at the foot of the mountains, and the crest of the
mountains was her boundary. She has always sat on
a little ledge of civilization, for four centuries on
a little ledge of Christendom, with a measureless background
of barbarism behind her. Those hills, the
slopes of which begin in the streets of the city, once
fenced in a ledge of Hellenic land from the native
barbarians of Illyricum. Then they fenced in a ledge
of Roman land from the Slavonic invader. Lastly,
when we first looked on them, when we first crossed
them, they still fenced in a ledge of Christian land
from the dominion of the Infidel. And the newest
arrangements of diplomacy make it still not wholly
impossible to use the language which we used then.
The Archduke of Austria and King of Dalmatia is
immediate sovereign of Ragusa and her ancient territory;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
when we cross the line between Ragusa and
Herzegovina, he rules only in the character familiar
to some even of his Imperial forefathers, that of the
man of the Turk. The Christian prince simply "administers;"
it is the Infidel Sultan who is still held
to reign. To form such a boundary as this has been
no mean calling for the heights which look down upon
Ragusa. It is well to climb those heights, best of all
to climb them by the road which so lately led, which
we might almost say still leads, from civilization to
barbarism, from Christendom to Islam, and to look
down on the city nestling between the sea and the
mountains. The view is of the same kind as the
view of the city from the sea. Rocks, inlets, walls,
and towers, come out in new and varied groupings,
but there is still no one prominent object. La Croma
indeed, with its fallen monastery&mdash;its fortress is not
seen&mdash;now comes in as a prominent object. But it
shows by its very prominence the difference between
this part of the Dalmatian coast, with its one island,
all but invisible on the map, lying close to the shore,
and the two archipelagos, one of small and obscure,
one of great and historic islands, which the voyager
has already passed by.</p>

<p>It would thus be well if we could look on Ragusa
both from the sea and from the mountains before we
approach the city by the one possible to reach it, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
the road which leads from its port of Gravosa. This
last is a picturesque haven of thoroughly Dalmatian
character, lying on a smooth inlet with a small fertile
fringe between the water and the mountains. The
road, rising and falling, looking out on both the
mountains and the sea, leads along among villas
and chapels which gradually grow into a suburb till
we reach the gate. Here we see not a few ruined
houses, houses which have remained ruined for nearly
seventy years, houses whose ruin was wrought by
Montenegrin hands in the days when Ragusa was an
unwilling possession of France and Montenegro a
valued ally of England. But, before we reach the
gate, we see what there was not in the time of Sir
Gardner Wilkinson, carriages standing for hire, carriages
no very long drive in which will take us over
the late borders of Christendom. In that suburb too
the traveller will most likely take up his quarters&mdash;quarters,
it may be, looking down straight on the
rocks and waves. And there, when war was raging at
no great distance, and when Ragusa was the special
centre of the purveyors of news, he was sure to hear
both the latest truths and the latest fables. But he
is still outside the city. No city brings better home
to us than Ragusa the Eastern hyperbole of cities
great and fenced up to heaven. We must leave the
military architect to discuss their military merits or
demerits. To the non-professional observer they seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
to belong to that type of fortification, between mediæval
and modern, which in these lands we naturally
call Venetian, inapplicable as that name is at Ragusa.
But they have clearly been strengthened and extended
in more modern times. The city lies in a kind of
hollow between the lower slopes of the mountain on
one side, and a ridge which lies between the mountain
and the sea, and which thus adds greatly to the
appearance of the fortifications as seen from the sea.
The one main street of Ragusa, the <i>Stradone</i>, thus lies
in a valley with narrow streets running down towards
it on both sides. Indeed, before the great earthquake
of 1667 which destroyed so much of old Ragusa, part
at least of this wide street was covered with water as a
canal. It is so pent in with buildings that we hardly
feel how near we are to the sea; yet the small port,
the true port of Ragusa, is very near at hand. The
two ends of the Stradone are guarded by gates, which
lead up&mdash;for the ascent is considerable&mdash;to the outer
gates at either end, still strong and still guarded,
reminding us that we are in what is still really a
border city. And over those gates we see, not the
winged lion for which we have learned to look almost
instinctively everywhere on these coasts, but the figure
of Saint Blaise, <i>San Biagio</i>, the patron of Ragusa,
whose relics form some of the choicest treasures in the
rich hoard of her once metropolitan church. We pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
under the saintly effigy, and we find that within the
walls the general aspect of the city is comparatively
modern. Most of the buildings, the metropolitan
church among them, were rebuilt after a great earthquake
in 1667. Such remains however of old Ragusa
as are still left are of such surpassing interest in the
history of architecture that we must keep them for a
more special examination.</p>

<p class="p2">The history of Ragusa, as we have already said, is
of a kind which must either be taken in at a glance or
else dealt with in the minutest detail. All Dalmatian
history for a good many centuries wants a more
thorough sifting than has ever been brought to bear
upon it. It wants it all the more because it is so
closely connected with early Venetian history, than
which no history is more utterly untrustworthy. But
we may safely gather that Ragusa had its origin in
the destruction of the Greek city of Epidauros, now
<i>Ragusa Vecchia</i>. The old Epidaurian colony fell, like
Salona, before the barbarians. Its inhabitants had no
ready-made city to flee to, but they founded a city on
the rocks which became Raousion or Ragusa. Whether
any part of the Ragusan peninsula had ever become
a dwelling-place of men at any earlier time it is
needless to inquire. It is enough that Ragusa now
became a city. As to the name of the city, our Imperial
guide helps us to one of his strange etymologies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
With him Epidauros has sunk into <span class="greek" title="Pitaura">&#928;&#943;&#964;&#945;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>&mdash;the
<i>t</i> seems to have supplanted the <i>d</i> at a much earlier

founded was first called from its site <span class="greek" title="Lausion">&#923;&#945;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, which

Latin, that it dawns on us that it means Greek. But,
under whatever name, the city on the rocks, small at
first, strengthened by refugees from Salona, grew and
prospered, and remained one of the outlying Roman
or Greek posts which in the days of Constantine, as
now, fringed the already barbarian land.</p>

<p>For some centuries after the time of Constantine
Porphyrogenitus, the history of Ragusa defies abridgement.
It is one web of intricate complications between
the Emperors of the East and West, the Republic of
Venice, the Kings of Hungary, Dalmatia, and Bosnia.
Somewhat later the story begins to be more intelligible,
when the actors get pretty well reduced to
Venice, the Turk, and the Empire in a new form,
that of Charles the Fifth. The republic of Ragusa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
contrived, which must surely have needed a good deal
of skill, to keep on good terms at once with Charles
and his son Philip and with their Turkish enemies.
Yet Ragusa, though never incorporated by anything
earlier than the dominion of Buonaparte, stood at different
times in a kind of dependent relation both to
Venice and to the Turk. At an earlier time the commonwealth
for a short time received a Venetian Count.
He was doubtless only meant to be like a foreign
<i>podestà</i>, but Venice was a very dangerous place for
Ragusa to bring a <i>podestà</i> from. In her later days
Ragusa must be looked on as being under the protection
of the Porte; but it was a protection which in no
way interfered with her full internal freedom&mdash;such
freedom at least as is consistent with the rule of an
oligarchy. The geography of Dalmatia keeps to this
day a curious memorial of the feeling which made
Ragusa dread the Turk less than she dreaded Venice.
To this day the Dalmatian kingdom does not extend
continuously along the Dalmatian coast. At two
points territory which till late changes was nominally
Turkish, which is still only "administered," not
"governed," by its actual ruler, comes down to the
Hadriatic coast. These are at Klek, at the bottom of
the gulf formed by the long Ragusan peninsula of
Sabioncello, and at Sutorina on the <i>Bocche</i> di Cattaro.
These two points mark the two ends of the narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
strip of coast which formed the territory of Ragusa.
Rather than have a common frontier with Venice at
either end, Ragusa willingly allowed the dominions of
the Infidel to come down to her own sea on either
side of her.</p>

<p>At last all dread from Venice passed away, but only
because Saint Mark gave way to a more dangerous
neighbour. The base conspiracy of Campoformio gave
Venetian Dalmatia to an Austrian master, and the strips
of Turkish territory which had once sheltered Ragusa
from the Venetian now for a while sheltered her from
the Austrian. Then the dividers of the spoil quarrelled;
the master of France took to himself what
France had betrayed to Austria. Presently he disliked
the small oasis of independence, and added
Ragusa to the dominion which was presently to take
in Rome and Lübeck. Lastly, when the days of
confusion were over, and order came back to the
world, order at Ragusa took the form of a new foreign
master. The Austrian, who had reigned for a moment
at Zara and Cattaro, but who had never reigned at
Ragusa, put forth his hand to filch Ragusa as he has
since filched Spizza. The motive need not be asked.
The pleasure of seizing the goods of a weaker neighbour
is doubtless enough in either case.</p>

<p>One point in the history of Ragusa which needs a
more thorough explanation than it has yet found is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the fact that the Roman or Greek city, founded by
men who had escaped from barbarian invaders&mdash;who
must surely have been largely Slavonic&mdash;has become
so pre-eminently a Slavonic city. There is no Italian
party at Ragusa. Not that the city is strongly Panslavonic;
the memory of local freedom has survived
through both forms of foreign rule. The Ragusan
aristocracy is Slavonic, and the Slavonic language
holds quite another position at Ragusa from what it
holds, for example, at Spalato. There all that claims
to be literature and cultivation is Italian; at Ragusa,
though Italian is familiarly spoken, the native literature
and cultivation is distinctly Slave. The difference
is marked in the very names of the two cities. Spalato
is in Slavonic <i>Spljet</i>, a mere corruption of the corrupt
Latin name. But Ragusa, on Slavonic lips&mdash;that is
on the lips of its own citizens speaking their own
language&mdash;is <i>Dubrovnik</i>, a perfectly independent Slavonic
name. It may be the name of some Slavonic
suburb or neighbouring settlement&mdash;like the <i>Wendisches
Dorf</i> at Lüneburg&mdash;but at all events it is no
corruption, no translation, of Latin <i>Ragusa</i> or of
Constantine's <i>Raousion</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">As for King Richard, the Ragusan story is that he
built the cathedral which was destroyed in 1667. It
is said that he vowed to build a church on the island
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
of La Croma, and that this purpose was changed
into building one in the city instead of the former
cathedral, while the commonwealth of Ragusa built a
church on the island. La Croma thus becomes connected
with the memory of two princes who died of
thrusting themselves in matters which did not concern
them. Richard, Count and King, might have
lived longer if he had not quarrelled with his vassal
at Limoges; Maximilian, Archduke and self-styled
Emperor, was perfectly safe at La Croma, but when
he took up the trade of a party-leader in Mexico, he
could hardly look for anything but a Mexican party-leader's
end. Of the monastery which formed his
dwelling-place the great church is so utterly desecrated
and spoiled that hardly anything can be made out.
But a good deal remains of the cloister, and at a little
distance stand the ruins of a beautiful little triapsidal
basilica, which surely, all save a few additions, belongs
to the age of the Lion-hearted King. Indeed we
should be tempted to fix on this, rather than any other
church of Ragusa or its island, as the work of Richard
himself. It looks greatly as if a Count of Poitiers
and Duke of Aquitaine had had a hand in it. A
single wide body, with three apses opening into it, is
not a Dalmatian idea, as it is not an English idea.
But something like it might easily be found in
Richard's own land of southern Gaul.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>That Richard did come to Ragusa and to La Croma
seems plain from the narrative in Roger of Howden.
He hired a ship at Corfu expressly to take him to
Ragusa. He landed "prope <i>Gazere</i> apud Ragusam."
<i>Gazere</i> suggests Jadera or Zara, but "Gazere apud Ragusam"
can hardly fail to mean La Croma. "<i>Gazere</i>"
is the Arabic name for <i>island</i>&mdash;the same which appears
in <i>Algesiras</i>&mdash;one of the Eastern words which passed
into the <i>lingua franca</i> of the Crusaders. After all,
Ragusa gives more interest to Richard than any that
it takes from him. Born and twice crowned in
England, he had little else to do with England than
to squeeze money out of it. It mattered little to
Englishmen&mdash;or to Normans either&mdash;whether their
Poitevin lord was astounding the world at Acre, at
Chaluz, or at La Croma.</p>

<p class="p2">Two other rather longer excursions than that to La
Croma may be profitably made from Ragusa. There
is, first of all, the short voyage to the site of the
city which Ragusa supplanted, the Dalmatian Epidauros,
now known by the odd name of <i>Ragusa
Vecchia</i>. Beyond a few inscriptions, there is really
next to nothing to be seen of the ancient city besides
its site; but the site is well worthy of study. It is
thoroughly the site for a Greek colony, and it has
much in common with the more famous site of Korkyra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
and Epidamnos. The city occupied a peninsula,
sheltered on the one hand by the mainland, on the
other by another promontory, forming the outer horn
of a small bay. In this position the town had the
sea on every side; it had a double harbour, and was
at the same time thoroughly sheltered on both sides.
Such a site was the perfection of Greek colonial ideas.
We have now got far away indeed from the earliest
type of city&mdash;the hill-fort which dreads the sea, and
which finds the need of the haven, and of the long
walls to join the haven to the city, only in later
times. The highest point of the promontory, the
akropolis&mdash;if we can use that name in a city of such
late date&mdash;is now forsaken, crowned only by a burying-ground
and sepulchral church. The view is a noble
one, looking out on the mainland and the sea, with
the neighbouring island crowned by a forsaken monastery,
and directly in front Ragusa herself on her
rocks, with the beginnings of the Dalmatian archipelago
rising in the distance. The modern town,
which is hardly more than a village, with two or
three churches and a small amount of fortification,
covers the isthmus and the lower ground of the promontory.
Such is all that is left of the northern city
of Asklêpios, the city which played its part alike in
the wars of Cæsar and in the wars of Belisarius, which
in the great revolution that followed the Slavonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
inroads perished to give birth to the more abiding
city from which it has strangely borrowed its later
name. That Ragusa Vecchia has so little to show
is no ground for despising it or passing it by; the
very lack of remains in some sort adds to the interest
of the spot.</p>

<p>The voyage from New to Old Ragusa is not a long
one. A shorter land journey on the same side of the
city will lead to the sea-side village of Breno, which
will not supply the traveller with anything in the
antiquarian line, but which will reward him with a
good deal of Dalmatian mountain and land scenery,
especially with a waterfall, though one not quite on
the scale of Kerka. And, to those who peer pryingly
into all corners, the little inn of the place will suggest
some memories of very modern history. That piece of
history it has been the interest of exalted personages
to keep unknown, and their efforts have been crowned
with a remarkable degree of success. As the inn at
Curzola contains picture memories of an unsuccessful
struggle for freedom in 1848, so the inn at Breno
contains picture memories of a more successful struggle
waged twenty-one years later in the same cause and
against the same enemy. When in 1869 the present
ruler of Austria and Dalmatia strove, in defiance of
every chartered right and every royal promise, to
trample under foot the ancient rights of the freemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
of the Bocche di Cattaro, the troops of the foreign
intruder were driven back in ignominious defeat by
the brave men of the mountains, and the master who
had sent them was forced to renew the promises
which he had striven to break. People still chatter
about the mythical exploits of Tell, but hardly any one
has heard of this little piece of successful resistance to
oppression done only twelve years back. The deed is
not forgotten by the neighbours of those who did it,
and in the inn at Breno rude pictures may be seen
showing the victorious Bocchese driving the troops of
the stranger down those heights which at Vienna or
at Budapest it seemed so easy a matter to bring into
bondage. Strange to say, the pictures which record
this Slavonic triumph have the legend beneath them
in the High-Dutch tongue. Stranger still, it is the
eye only and not the ear by which any knowledge of
the matter is to be picked up. The wary native,
even when spoken to in his own tongue, will not
enlarge on the subjects of those pictures to a man
in Western garb. It is perhaps not without reason
if a stranger in Western garb is suspected in those
parts to be a spy of the enemy.</p>

<p>If the voyage from New to Old Ragusa is not a
long one, the sail on the other side of the city up the
river's mouth to Ombla is shorter still. Its starting-point
will be, not Ragusa itself but its port of Gravosa.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Here the main object is scenery; but several houses,
one at least of which will deserve some further mention,
a nearly forsaken monastery with a good bell-tower
and a not ungraceful church, and one or two
living or forsaken chapels may be taken in, and they
help us to complete some inferences as to the architecture
of the district. But our business at this
moment is mainly with the basin which lies at the
foot of the limestone rock. The hills of Greece and
Dalmatia constantly suggest, to one who knows the
West of England, the kindred, though far lowlier,
hills of Mendip. As the gorge under the akropolis of
Mykênê at once suggests the gorge of Cheddar, so
the basin of the Trebenitza at Ombla suggests, though
the scale is larger, the basin of the Axe at Wookey
Hole. The river runs out from the bottom of the
rocks, and, to those who have been adventurous
enough to cross the heights and to make their way
through the desolate land of Herzegovina&mdash;the very
land of limestone in all forms&mdash;as far as Trebinje,
the river that reappears at Ombla is an old friend.
There seems no doubt that it is the Trebenitza which,
after hiding itself in a <i>katabothra</i>, comes out again to
light in the Ombla basin. The journey to Trebinje
itself is in its own nature less exciting now than it
was in 1875. What it was when the drive thither
from Ragusa enabled the traveller to say that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
been into "Turkey," and that he had seen a little of a
land in a state of warfare, may perhaps be worth some
separate mention. At present it is reported that
Trebinje is cleaner than it was then, that it has been
adorned with a <i>Rudolfsplatz</i>, and that justice is there
administered to its Slavonic folk, Christian and
Mussulman, in the tongue of which <i>Rudolfsplatz</i> is a
specimen. It would therefore seem that the direct
rule of the stranger is at least better than his "administration."
At Ragusa men are allowed to speak
their own tongue in which they were born.</p>

<h3>RAGUSAN ARCHITECTURE.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1877&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We have spoken in a former article of the general
aspect and the historical position of the city and
commonwealth of Ragusa, her hills, her walls, her
havens, her union of freedom from the lion of Saint
Mark with half dependence on the crescent of
Mahomet. But this ancient and isolated city has yet
something more to tell of. There are several of the
municipal and domestic buildings of the fallen republic,
buildings which, as far as we know, have
never been described or illustrated in detail in any
English work, and of which no worthy representation
can be found on the spot. In the work of Eitelberger
much will be found; but for the ordinary English
student there is no help at all. Yet, on the strength
of these buildings, Ragusa may really claim a place
among those cities which stand foremost in the history
of architectural progress. And this fact is the more
remarkable, and the more to be insisted on, because
of the seemingly general belief that there is little or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
nothing to see at Ragusa in the way of architecture.
But the truth is that far more of the old city escaped
the earthquake of 1667 than would be thought at
first sight. Because the cathedral is later, because
the general aspect of the main street is later, the idea
is suggested that nothing is left but the municipal
palace. That alone would be a most important exception,
but it is by no means the only one. If the
traveller leaves the main street and turns up the
narrow alleys which run from it up the hills on either
side, alleys many of them which, at present at least,
lead to nothing, he will find many scraps of domestic
architecture which must belong to times earlier than
the great blow of the seventeenth century. Signs of
that blow are seen in many places in the form of
scraps of detail of various kinds irregularly built up
in the wall; but there are a great number of pointed
doorways still in their places which no man can think
are later than 1667. Some of these are simply
pointed; others combine the pointed arch with the
tympanum, sometimes with both the tympanum and
the spandril. There is also a not unpleasing type of
<i>Renaissance</i> doorway, a lintel resting on two pilasters
with floriated capitals, which one can hardly believe
are due to a time so late as the days after the earthquake.
At all events, if they are later than the
earthquake, they only go to strengthen the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
position which we have to lay down, namely the
way in which early forms lived on at Ragusa to an
amazingly late date. This same examination of the
narrow streets will also bring to light a few, but
only a few, windows of the Venetian Gothic. The
strength of Ragusa, as far as scraps of this kind are
concerned, undoubtedly lies in its doorways.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="i279" id="i279"></a>
<img src="images/i279.jpg" width="292" height="600" alt="Franciscan Church, Ragusa" />
<p class="caption">TOWER OF FRANCISCAN CHURCH, RAGUSA.</p>
</div>

<p>In the churches too there is more left than the
mere scraps which are built up again. Parts at least
of the tall towers&mdash;neither of them detached&mdash;of the
Franciscan and Dominican churches, the former in
the main street, the latter near the eastern gate, are
also earlier. In the former the line of junction
between the older tower and the ugly church which
has been built up against it is clearly to be seen.
The upper stage of this tower, and the small cupola
which crowns it, <i>may</i> be later than the earthquake;
but if so, they have caught the spirit of earlier work
in an unusual degree, and all the lower part is in a
form of Italian Gothic less unpleasing than usual.
Both this tower and that of the Dominican church
show how long the general type of the earliest Romanesque
campaniles went on. Save in the small cupola,
this tower has the perfect air, and almost the details,
of a tower of the eleventh century: three ranges of
windows with mid-wall shafts rise over one another;
only they are grouped under containing arches in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
what in England we should call a Norman fashion.
But, as this tower forms part of a Dominican
monastery, it cannot be earlier than the thirteenth
century, and its smaller details also cannot belong
to any earlier date. Yet the general effect of this
tower, even more than of the other, is that of a tower
of the Primitive type. The Dominican church also
keeps some details of Italian Gothic which must be
older than the earthquake, and the cloister is one of
the best specimens of that style. Its groupings of
tracery under round arches, the poverty of design in
the tracery itself, strike us as weak, if our thoughts
go back to Salisbury or to Zürich; but the general
effect is good, and the cloister&mdash;as distinguished from
the buildings above it&mdash;may almost be called beautiful.
Of more importance in the history of Ragusan
architecture is the Franciscan cloister. Being Franciscan,
it cannot be earlier than the thirteenth century,
and it may well be much later. But it is essentially
Romanesque in style. The general effect of the tall
shafts which support its narrow round arches differs
indeed a good deal from the general effect of the more
massive Romanesque cloisters to which we are used
elsewhere. But it is essentially one with them in
style, and it is one of the many witnesses to the way
in which at Ragusa early forms were kept in use till
a late time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>But the architectural glory of Ragusa is certainly
not to be looked for among its churches. The most
truly instructive work that Ragusa has to show in any
of its ecclesiastical buildings does not show itself at
first sight, and its full significance is not likely to
be understood till the civic and domestic buildings
of the city and its suburbs have been well studied.
When this has been done, it will be easily seen that
certain arches and capitals in the subordinate buildings
of the Dominican church have their part in the
history of Ragusan art; but the great civic buildings
must be seen and mastered first. Of these two of
the highest interest escaped the common overthrow.
They both show the Italian Gothic in its best shape;
but they also show something else which is of far
higher value. They show that peculiar form of <i>Renaissance</i>
which can hardly be called <i>Renaissance</i> in
any bad sense, which is in truth a last outburst of
Romanesque, a living child of classical forms, not a
dead imitation of them. Examples of this kind often
meet us in Italy; we see something of it in the north
side of the great <i>piazza</i> at Venice as compared with
the southern side; but the Ragusan examples go
beyond anything that we know of elsewhere. Give
the palace of Ragusa&mdash;the palace, not of a Doge, but
of a Rector&mdash;the same size, the same position, as the
building which answers to it at Venice, and we should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
soon see that the city which so long held her own
against Venice in other ways could hold her own in
art also. The Venetian arcade cannot for a moment
be compared to the Ragusan; the main front of the
Ragusan building has escaped the addition of the
ugly upper story which disfigures the Venetian. As
wholes, of course no one can compare the two in
general effect. Saint Blaise must yield to Saint
Mark. But set Saint Blaise's palace on Saint Mark's
site; carry out his arcade to the same boundless
extent, and there is little doubt which would be the
grander pile. The Venetian building overwhelms by
its general effect; the Ragusan building will better
stand the test of minute study.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="i284" id="i284"></a>
<img src="images/i284.jpg" width="500" height="367" alt="Palace, Ragusa" />
<p class="caption">PALACE, RAGUSA.</p>
</div>

<p>The palace of the Ragusan commonwealth was
begun in 1388, and finished in 1435, in the reign, as
an inscription takes care to announce, of the Emperor
Siegmund. What name shall we give to the style
of this most remarkable building, at all events to the
style of its admirable arcade? Here are six arches&mdash;why
did not the architect carry on the design through
the whole length of the building?&mdash;which show what,
as late as the fifteenth century, a round-arched style
could still do when it followed its natural promptings,
instead of either binding itself by slavish precedents
or striving after a helpless imitation of foreign forms.
Never mind the date; here is Romanesque in all its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
truth and beauty; here, in the land which gave Rome
so many of her greatest Cæsars, the arcade of Ragusa
may worthily end the series which began with the
arcades of Spalato. Siegmund, the last but one to
wear the crown of Diocletian in the Eternal City, has
his name not quite unworthily engraved on a building
less removed in style than a distance of more than
eleven centuries would have led us to expect from
the everlasting house of Jovius. Does some pedantic
Vitruvian brand the columns as too short? The
architect has grasped the truth that, as the arch
takes the place of the entablature, the height of the
arch may fairly be taken out of the height of the
column. Does he blame the massive abaci? They
are wrought to bear the greater immediate weight
which the arch brings upon the capital, and they
avoid such shifts as the Ravenna stilt and the Byzantine
double capital. Does he blame the capitals,
which certainly do not follow the exact pattern of
any Vitruvian order? Let us answer boldly, Why
should art be put in fetters? A Corinthian capital
is a beautiful form; but why should the hand of man
be kept back from devising other beautiful forms?
The Ragusan architect has ventured to cover some
of his capitals with foliage which does not obey any
pedantic rule; in others he has ventured&mdash;like the
artists of the noble capitals which may still be seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
in the Capitol and in Caracalla's baths&mdash;to bring in
the forms of animal and of human, as well as of
vegetable, life. In one point his taste seems slightly
to have failed him; on some of the capitals the
winged figures with which they are wrought savour
a little of the vulgar <i>Renaissance</i>. But who shall
blame the capital long ago engraved and commented
on by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in which however a
neighbouring inscription shows that tradition was right
in seeing the form of Asklêpios, and not that of a
mere mortal alchemist, though tradition was certainly
wrong in believing that Asklêpios had been brought
ready made from his old home at Epidauros? And
the capitals bear arches worthy of them, round arches
with mouldings and ornaments, which thoroughly fit
their shape, though, like the capitals, they do not
servilely follow any prescribed rule. Altogether this
arcade only makes us wish for more, for a longer range
from the same hand. Compare it with the vulgar
Italian work of the two neighbouring churches. Pisa
and Durham might have stretched out the right hand
of fellowship to Romanesque Ragusa before the earthquake;
they would have held it back from Jesuited
Ragusa after it.</p>

<p>The rest of the front cannot be called worthy of
this admirable arcade. The windows behind the arcade
are of the worse, those above it are of the better, kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
of Italian Gothic. These last in fact are about as
good as Italian Gothic can be. They are well proportioned
two-light windows with Geometrical tracery,
and in the general effect they really agree better
than could have been looked for with the admirable
arches below. Still they are Italian Gothic, and at
Ragusa we should not welcome the loveliest form of
tracery that Carlisle or Selby could give us. A Pisan
arcade, pierced for light wherever light was wanted,
would have been the right thing for the columns and
arches to bear aloft. He who duly admires the arcade
will do well to shut his eyes as he turns round the
corner by the west front of the cathedral; but let him
go inside, and the court, if not altogether worthy of
the outer arcade, is no contemptible specimen of the
same style. It contains one or two monuments of
Ragusan worthies. The figure of Roland, which lay
there neglected when we first saw Ragusa, has since
been set up again in the open <i>piazza</i>. And, strange
to say in these lands, it ventures to proclaim itself as
having been set up, as it might have been in the old
time, by the free act of the <i>commune</i> of Ragusa, without
any of those cringing references to a foreign power
which are commonly found expedient under foreign
rule. The court is entered by a side door with two
ancient knockers, one of them a worthy fellow of the
great one at Durham or of that which we saw more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
lately at Curzola. But its chief interest comes from
its strictly architectural forms, and from the comparison
of them with those which are made use of on the
outside. The court is very small, and it is surrounded
on all sides, save that which is filled by the grand
staircase, by an arcade of two, supporting a second
upper range. The composition is thus better than
that of the front itself, as there are two harmonious
stages in the same style, without any intrusion of
foreign elements, like the pointed windows in the
front; but the arcades themselves, though very good
and simple, do not carry out the wonderful boldness
and originality of the outer range. Columns with
tongues to their base with flowered capitals, showing
a remembrance, but not a servile remembrance, of
Corinthian models, support round arches. Over these
is the upper range of two round arches over each one
below, resting on coupled shafts, the arrangement
which, from the so-called tomb of Saint Constantia,
has spread to so many Romanesque cloisters and to so
many works of the Saracen. Were this range open,
instead of being foolishly glazed, this design of two
stages of a true Romanesque, simpler, but perhaps
more classical, than the outer arcade, would form a
design thoroughly harmonious and satisfactory.</p>

<p>Now when we come to examine this inner court
more minutely, we shall find that it is certainly of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
later date than the outer arcade, and that it supplanted
earlier work which formed part of the same design as
the outer arcade. It is impossible to believe that the
court is later than the great earthquake; but 1667
was not the only year in which Ragusa underwent
visitations of that kind; and it is an allowable guess
that a rebuilding took place after an earlier earthquake
in the beginning of the sixteenth century. That
some change took place at some time is certain.
There are preparations for spanning arches at one
point of the outer wall of the court, which could never
have agreed with the position of the present columns.
And we have a most interesting piece of documentary
evidence which carries us further. In a manuscript
account of the building of the palace, it is mentioned
that at the entrance were two columns, on the capital
of one of which was carved the Judgement of Solomon,
while the other showed the Rector of Ragusa sitting
to administer justice after the model of Solomon.
Now this cannot refer to the outer arcade, where none
of the capitals show those subjects. Still less is there
anything like it in the arcade of the court, nor can
there have been since the present arrangement was
made. But the description is no freak of the imagination;
both capitals are in being; one of them is still
within the palace. The capital showing the Rector
in his chair dispensing justice to his fellow-citizens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
is built in at a corner in the upper story of the court.
And a capital of exactly the same style, and with the
Judgement of Solomon carved on one face of it, may
still be seen in the garden of a house outside the city
of which we shall have presently to speak. It is thus
perfectly plain that the inner court was rebuilt at some
time later than the days of Siegmund, and that this
rebuilding displaced an inner design more in harmony
with the outer arcade, and of which these two capitals
formed a part.</p>

<p>To our mind this palace, to which Sir Gardner
Wilkinson hardly does justice, and of which Mr. Neale
takes no notice at all, really deserves no small place
in the history of Romanesque art. It shows how late
the genuine tradition lingered on, and what vigorous
offshoots the old style could throw off, even when it
might be thought to be dead. One or two capitals
show that the Ragusan architect knew of the actual
<i>Renaissance</i>. But it was only in that one detail that
he went astray. In everything else he started from
sound principles, and from them vigorously developed
for himself. And the fruit of his work was a building
which thoroughly satisfies every requirement of criticism,
and on which the eye gazes with ever increased
delight, as one of the fairest triumphs of human skill
within the range of the builder's art.</p>

<p>But the palace must not be spoken of as if it stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
altogether alone among the buildings of the city.
There is another civic building, which, though it does
not reach the full perfection of its great neighbour,
must also be treated as a true fruit, in some sort a
more remarkable fruit, of the same spirit which called
its greater neighbour into being. This is the building
which acted at once in the characters of mint and
custom-house, the second character being set forth by
its name wrought in nails on the great door. This
building stands just where the main street and the
<i>piazza</i> join, close by the arch leading to the town-gate.
Here we have an arcade of five, the columns of which
are crowned with capitals, Composite in their general
shape, but not slavishly following technical precedents,
nor all of them exactly alike. They have a heavy
abacus, which, as well as the soffit of the round arch,
is enriched with flowered work. One or two of them
are none the better for being new chiselled in modern
times. Here is something which is quite unlike
Northern Romanesque, but which still is absolutely
identical with it in principle. The column and the
round arch are there in their purity, and the enrichment
is of a kind which we instinctively feel is in place at
Ragusa, though it would be out of place at Caen or
Mainz or Durham. Whatever the date may be, the
thing is thoroughly good, incomparably better than
either the Italian Gothic or the cosmopolite Jesuit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
style. Above the arcade are windows with the usual
Venetian attempt at tracery, a large square window
between two with ogee arches; above is a stage with
square windows, which we may hope is a later addition.
The merits of the three stages lessen as they
get higher. Yet from the date, when we come to find
it out, it seems not impossible that the arcade and
both the stages above it may really be of the same
date. In the inner court there are no such discordant
elements as there are without, though the forms of
different styles are quite as much mingled. Octagonal
piers support round arches; pointed doorways with
thoroughly Ragusan tympana open into the chamber
behind them. On this arcade rests another, with
round arches on the short sides of the court, and
pointed arches on the long sides, rising from columns
and square piers alternately. Above is a range which
might as well be away. Square windows, round
Ragusan windows, might well be endured; but <i>Renaissance</i>
shields and <i>Renaissance</i> angels show that
the infection had begun. Now this beautiful piece of
Romanesque work&mdash;we give it that name in defiance
of dates&mdash;was finished in 1520, when the world on the
southern side of the Alps was, for the most part, running
after the dreariest forms of the mere revived
Italian. This amazingly late date makes this building
even more wonderful than the palace, though it certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
is not its rival in beauty. The arcades, good
as they are, cannot be compared to those of the palace,
and the Venetian work above is still more inferior.
Still, the later the date, the more honour to the architect
who designed such a work at such a time. And
the later the date, the more likely that he built his
arcade according to the promptings of his own genius,
and added the two ranges of windows in deference to
the two rival fashions of his time.</p>

<p class="caption">DOGANA, RAGUSA.</p>
</div>

<p>The arcade of this building, taken alone without reference
to the windows above, is the last link in a chain
which shows that the preservation of good architectural
ideas at so late a time is no mere accident. Indeed, if
we pass from public buildings within the city to private
buildings outside of it, we shall begin to doubt whether
the <i>dogana</i> is the last chain, and whether there are
not still later buildings which are fairly entitled to
the Romanesque name. The best of the houses of
the Ragusan patricians are to be found, not within the
city, but by the port at Gravosa, and further on on
the way to Ombla. Several of those, while their other
features are Venetian Gothic, or even later still, have&mdash;commonly
in their upper <i>loggie</i>&mdash;a column or two
supporting a round arch, which are certainly not
vulgar <i>Renaissance</i>, and which keep on the sound
tradition of the palace and the <i>dogana</i>. The finest
of these is the house of the Counts Caboga, known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
as Batahovina, on the coast on the way to Ombla.
Here, as in the palace, as in the <i>dogana</i>, an arcade of
this late local Romanesque supports an upper story
of Venetian Gothic, very inferior and most likely
much later than that in either of the civic buildings.
It has however at each end an open <i>loggia</i> matching
the arcade below. The columns, plain and with twisted
flutes&mdash;distant kinsfolk of Waltham, Durham, Dunfermline,
and Lindisfarn&mdash;have capitals such as we
might look for in much earlier Romanesque.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="i298" id="i298"></a>
<img src="images/i298.jpg" width="500" height="364" alt="Caboga House, Gravosa" />
<p class="caption">CABOGA HOUSE, GRAVOSA.</p>
</div>
<p>This, we may note by the way, is the house in
whose garden the column from the palace, wrought
with the Judgement of Solomon, still lies hid. Indeed
we might go further away from the palace than the
<i>loggie</i> of the houses. At Ragusa art extends itself to
objects which might have been thought hardly capable
of artistic treatment. Stone is common, and it is used
for all manner of purposes. Among other things stone
vine-props are common. In not a few cases these
take the form of columns, slenderer doubtless than
the rules of classical proportion, realizing the description
of Cassiodorus about the tall columns like reeds,
the lofty buildings propped as it were on the shafts of
spears. Sometimes the columns are fluted or twisted; in
a great many cases they have real capitals, with various
forms according to taste. It often happens that a row
of such columns, whether on a house-top or in a vineyard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
really becomes an architectural object, a genuine
colonnade. Here the style, the construction at least, is
Greek rather than Romanesque; but the principle is
the same. A good and rational artistic form is kept in
use, and is applied to a purpose for which it is fitted.</p>

<p>All these examples, the palace, the <i>dogana</i>, the
houses, the remains in the Dominican church, we
might almost say the vine-props, look one way. All
point to the existence of a Ragusan style, to an
unbroken Romanesque tradition, which could not
wholly withstand the inroads of the <i>pseudo</i>-Gothic
of Italy, but which could at least keep its place
alongside of the intruder. All help us to see how
instructive must have been the course of architectural
developement at Ragusa, and how much has
been lost to the history of art by the destruction
of so many of the buildings of the city in the great
earthquake. It is easy to see that for a long time
the struggle between the genuine Romanesque tradition,
the Italian Gothic, and the new ideas of the
<i>Renaissance</i>, must have been very hard. How long
real Romanesque went on, bringing in new developements
of its own, but remaining still as truly Romanesque
by unbroken succession as anything at Pisa
or Durham, is shown by the noble arches of the
palace, and the still later <i>dogana</i>. The slight touch
of <i>Renaissance</i> in some of the capitals of the palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
in no sort takes away from the general purity of the
style. Still over these noble arcades are windows of
Venetian Gothic, and one of the most characteristic
features of the Ragusan streets are the flat-headed
doorways. But these, alternating as they do with
pointed ones, help to make out our case. On the
other hand, it is equally plain that in some cases
the <i>Renaissance</i> came in early. A little chapel by
the basin at Ombla, bearing date 1480, is in a confirmed
<i>Renaissance</i> style, and looks more like 1580.
Yet of true <i>Renaissance</i> there is very little. One
large house in the city, older than the earthquake,
stands quite alone as the kind of thing which might
easily have been built in Italy or copied in England.
But at Ragusa, in the near neighbourhood of several
native doorways of different shapes, of many native
vine-props, of several native wells&mdash;for wells too take
an artistic style and copy the form of a capital&mdash;the
regular trim Palladian building looks strangely out
of place. Even in the <i>Stradone</i>, where in the houses
there is little architecture of any kind, a touch of
ancient effect is kept in the form of the shops, with
their arches and stone dressers, thoroughly after the
mediæval pattern. And some architectural features
never died out. The round window with tracery goes
on long after every other feature of Romanesque or
Gothic is forgotten. It is to be seen in endless little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
chapels of very late date in the city and suburbs,
sometimes standing apart, sometimes attached to
private houses.</p>

<p>The plain conclusion from all this is that at Ragusa
the use of the round arch for the chief arcades
never went out of use; that it always remained as a
constructive feature, passing from Romanesque to
<i>Renaissance</i>, if fully developed <i>Renaissance</i> can at
Ragusa be said to exist at all, without any intermediate
Gothic stage, and continuing to invent and adopt
any kind of ornament which suited its constructive
form. In windows and doorways, on the other hand,
the forms of the Italian Gothic came in and stood
their ground till a very late date. In most cases we
wish the Venetian features away; in the upper story
of the palace they may be endured; but conceive
palace, <i>dogana</i>, Caboga house, with smaller arcades
and windows to match the great constructive arches.
Such buildings as these, now so few, make us sigh
over the effects of the great earthquake, and over the
treasures of art which it must have swallowed up.
If Ragusa, in her earlier day, contained a series of
churches to match her civic arcades, she might claim,
in strictly artistic interest, to stand alongside of
Rome, Ravenna, Pisa, and Lucca. Her churches of
the fifteenth century must have been worthy to rank
with anything from the fourth century to the twelfth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
One longs to be able to study the Ragusan style in
more than these few examples. It is not indeed
absolutely peculiar either to Ragusa or to Dalmatia.
Many buildings in Italy and Sicily show a good
native Romanesque tradition, holding its own against
the sham Gothic, and showing a good fight against
the <i>Renaissance</i>. Not a few arcades, not a few
cloisters, of this kind may be found here and there.
But it would be hard to light on another such group
of buildings as the palace, the <i>dogana</i>, and their
fellows. In any case the Dalmatian coast may hold
its head high among the artistic regions of the world.
It is no small matter that the harmonious and consistent
use of the arch and column should have begun
at Spalato, and that identically the same constructive
form should still be found, eleven ages later, putting
forth fresh and genuine shapes of beauty at Ragusa.</p>

[This paper, as giving the impressions of a first visit to the soil of
Herzegovina, during an early stage of the war, has been reprinted, with
the change of a few words, as it was first written.]</p>

<p>The first step which any man takes beyond the bounds
of Christendom can hardly fail to mark a kind of
epoch in his life. And the epoch becomes more
memorable when the first step is taken into an actual
"seat of war," where the old strife between Christian
and Moslem is still going on with all the bitterness of
crusading days. In Europe it is now in one quarter
only that such a step can be made by land with somewhat
less of formality than is often needed in passing
from one Christian state to another. It is now only
in the great south-eastern peninsula that the frontier
of the Turk marches upon the dominions of any
Christian power; and, now that Russia and the Turk
are no longer immediate neighbours, the powers on
which his frontier marches are, with one exception,
states which have been more or less fully liberated
from his real or asserted dominion. That exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
is to be found in the Hadriatic dominions of Austria;
and certainly no more striking contrast can be
imagined than that which strikes the traveller as he
passes on this side from Christian to Moslem dominion.
Let us suppose him to be at Ragusa, with his ears
full of tales from the seat of war, all of which cannot
be true, but all of which may possibly be false. The
insurgents have burned a Turkish village. No; it
was a Christian village, and the Turks burned it.
The Turks have murdered seven Roman Catholics.
The Turks have murdered seventy Roman Catholics&mdash;a
difference this last which may throw light on some
cases of disputed numbers in various parts of history.
The Turks have threatened Austrian subjects. Austrian
subjects have attacked the Turks. An Italian
has had his head cut off by the Turks just beyond the
frontier. A Turkish soldier has been found lying
dead in the road a little further on. These two
last stories come on the authority of men who have
seen the bodies, so that we have got within the bounds
of credible testimony. Meanwhile the one thing about
which there is no doubt is the presence and the
wretchedness of the unhappy Herzegovinese women
and children whose homes have been destroyed either
by friends or by enemies, and who are seeking such
shelter as public and private charity can give in
hospitable Ragusa. All these things kindle a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
desire to get at least a glimpse of the land where
something is certainly going on, though it may not be
easy to know exactly what. Between Ragusa and
Trebinje there is just now no actual fighting; the road
is reported to be perfectly safe; only it is advisable to
get a passport <i>visé</i> by the Turkish consul. The passports
are <i>visé</i>, but, so far for the credit of the Turks,
it must be added that, though duly carried, they were
never asked for. The party, four in number&mdash;three
English and one Russian&mdash;presently set forth from
Ragusa. It is now as easy to get a carriage at Ragusa
as in any other European town. So our party sets out
behind two of the small but strong and sure-footed
horses of the country, to get a glimpse of what, to two
at least of their number, were the hitherto unknown
lands of Paynimrie.</p>

<p>As long as we are on Austrian territory there is
nothing to fear or to complain of but those evils
which no kings or laws can cure. The day was rainy&mdash;so
rainy that a word was once or twice murmured in
favour of turning back; but it was deemed faint-hearted
to turn again in an undertaking which had
been once begun. On the Austrian side the rain was
certainly to be regretted, as damping the charm of
the glorious prospect from the zigzag road which
winds up from Ragusa to the frontier point of Drino.
Ragusa, nestling among hills and forts and castles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
the isle of La Croma keeping guard over the haven
which has ceased to be a haven, the wide Hadriatic
stretching to the horizon, form a picture surpassed by
but few pictures even in the glorious scenery of the
Dalmatian coast. On the other side, it was perhaps
no great harm if the rain made the savage land
between Drino and Trebinje seem more savage still.
At the top of the height the Austrian guard-house is
reached, a guard-house which the line of the frontier
causes to be overlooked by a Turkish fort above it.
The guardians of the borders of Christendom look
wild enough in their local dress; but the wildness is
all outside, though one certainly does not envy them
their watch on so dreary a spot. Hard by is the place
where the Italian lost his head; but the Italian was
openly in the ranks of the insurgents; so, though
the thought is a little thrilling, our present travellers
feel no real danger for their heads. The frontier is
now passed; we are in the land where the Asiatic and
Mahometan invader still holds European and Christian
nations in bondage. We see no immediate sign of
his presence. The Turkish guard-house is at some
distance from the Austrian, in order to watch the
pass on the other side, where the road begins to go
down towards Trebinje, as the Austrian guards the
road immediately up from Ragusa. But, if as yet
we see not the Turk, we feel his presence in another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
way. In one point at least we have suddenly changed
from civilization to barbarism. The excellently kept
Austrian road at once stops&mdash;that is to say, its excellent
keeping stops; the road goes on, only it is no
longer mended in Austrian but in Turkish fashion&mdash;a
fashion of which the dullest English highway board
would perhaps be ashamed. We presently begin to
see something cf the land of Herzegovina, or at least
of that part of it which lies between Ragusa and
Trebinje. It may be most simply described as a
continuous mass of limestone. The town lies in a
plain surrounded by hills, and it would be untrue to
say that that plain is altogether without trees or
without cultivation. Close to the town tobacco grows
freely, and before we reach the town, as we draw near
to the river Trebenitza, the dominion of utter barrenness
has come to an end. But the first general impression
of the land is one of utter barrenness, and
for a great part of our course, long after we have
come down into the lower ground, this first general
impression remains literally true. It is not like a
mountain valley or a mountain coast, with a fringe
of inhabited and cultivated land at the foot of the
heights. All is barren; all is stone; stone which, if
it serves no other human purpose, might at least be
used to make the road better. That road, in all its
Turkish wretchedness, goes on and on, through masses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
of limestone of every size, from the mountains which
form the natural wall of Trebinje down to lumps
which nature has broken nearly small enough for the
purposes of MacAdam. Through the greater part of
the route not a house is to be seen; there are one or
two near the frontier; there is hardly another till we
draw near to the town, when we pass a small village
or two, of which more anon. Through the greater
part of the route not a living being is to be seen. In
such a wilderness we might at least have looked for
birds of prey; but no flight of vultures, no solitary
eagle, shows itself. As for man, he seems absent also,
save for one great exception, which exception gives
the journey to Trebinje its marked character, and
which brings thoroughly home to us that we are
passing through a seat of war.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, early in the war, the
insurgents were attacking the town of Trebinje, and,
among later rumours, were tales of renewed attacks in
that quarter. But at the time of our travellers' journey
the road was perfectly open, and no actual fighting
was going on in the neighbourhood. Trebinje however
was on the watch: the plain before the town was
full of tents, and, long before the town or the tents
were within sight, the sight of actual campaigners
gave a keen feeling of what was going on. Flour
is to be had in the stony land only by seeking it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
within the Austrian frontier, and to the Austrian
frontier accordingly the packhorses go, with a strong
convoy of Turkish soldiers to guard them. Twice
therefore in the course of their journey, going and
coming back, did our travellers fall in with the
Turkish troops on their way to and from the land of
food. For men who had never before seen anything
of actual warfare there was something striking in the
first sight of soldiers, not neat and trim as for some
day of parade, but ragged, dirty, and weather-stained
with the actual work of war. And there was something
more striking still in the thought that these
were the old enemies of Europe and of Christendom,
the representatives of the men who stormed the gates
of the New Rome and who overthrew the chivalry of
Burgundy and Poland at Nikopolis and at Varna.
But the Turk in a half-European uniform has lost
both his picturesqueness and his terrors, and the best
troops in Europe would be seen to no great advantage
on such a day and on such a march. And
perhaps Turkish soldiers, like all other men and
things, look differently according to the eyes with
which they are looked at. Some eyes noticed them as
being, under all their disadvantages, well-made and
powerful-looking men. Other eyes looked with less
pleasure on the countenances of the barbarians who
were brought to spread havoc over Christian lands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
All however agreed that, as the armed votaries of
the Prophet passed before them, the unmistakeable
features of the Æthiop were not lacking among the
many varieties of countenance which they displayed.
But the Paynim force, though it did no actual deed
of arms before the eyes of our party, did something
more than simply march along the road. The realities
of warfare came out more vividly when, at every
fitting point, skirmishers were thrown off to occupy
each of the peaked hills and other prominent points
which line the road like so many watchtowers.</p>

<p>The armed force went and came back that day
without any need for actually using their arms. Insurgent
attacks on the convoys are a marked feature
of the present war; but our travellers had not the
opportunity of seeing such a skirmish. Still before
long they did see one most speaking sign of war and
its horrors. By the banks of the Trebenitza a burned
village first came in sight. The sight gives a kind
of turn to the whole man; still a burned village is not
quite so ugly in reality as it sounds in name. The
stone walls of the houses are standing; it is only the
roofs that are burned off. But who burned the village,
and why? He would be a very rash man who should
venture to say, without the personal witness of those
who burned it, or saw it burned. Was it a Christian
village burned by Turks? Was it a Turkish village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
burned by Christians? Was it a Christian village
burned by the insurgents because its inhabitants
refused to join in the insurrection? Was it a Christian
village burned by its own inhabitants rather than
leave anything to fall into the hands of the Turks?
If rumour is to be trusted, cases of all these four
kinds have happened in the course of the war. All
that can be said is that the village has a church and
shows no signs of a mosque, and that, while the houses
were burned, the church was not. The burned village
lay near a point of the river which it is usually
possible to ford in a carriage. This time however,
the Trebenitza&mdash;a river which, like so many Greek
rivers, loses itself in a <i>katabothra</i>&mdash;was far too full
to be crossed in this way, and our travellers had to
leave their carriage and horses and get to Trebinje
as they could. After some scrambling over stones,
a boat was found, which strongly suggested those
legends of Charon which are far from having died
out of the memory of the Christians of the East. A
primitive punt it was, with much water in it, which
Charon slowly ladled out with a weapon which suggested
the notion of a gigantic spoon. Charon himself
was a ragged object enough, but, as became his
craft, he seemed master of many tongues. We may
guess that his native speech would be Slave, but one
of the company recognized some of his talk for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Turkish, and the demand for the two oboli of old
was translated into the strange phrase of "dieci groschen."
To our travellers the words suggested was the
expiring coinage of the German Empire; they did not
then take it how widely the <i>groat</i> had spread its name
in the south-eastern lands. At first hearing, the name
sounded strange on the banks of the Trebenitza; but
in the absence of literal <i>groats</i> or <i>groschen</i>, the currency
of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was found
in practice to do just as well. Then our four pilgrims
crossed and crossed again, the second time with much
gladness of heart, as for a while things looked as if
no means of getting back again were forthcoming,
and it was not every one of the party that had a heart
stout enough even to think of trying to swim or wade.
Charon's second appearance was therefore hailed with
special pleasure.</p>

<p>From the crossing-place to Trebinje itself our travellers
had to trudge as they could along a fearfully
rough Turkish path&mdash;not rougher though than some
Dalmatian and Montenegrin paths&mdash;till they reached
the town itself, which this delay gave them but little
time to examine. The suburbs stretched along the
hillside; below, the tents of the Turkish troops were
pitched on one side; the Mahometan burial-ground
lay on the other. After so much time and pains had
been spent in getting to Trebinje, a glimpse of Trebinje
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
itself was all that was to be had. But even a glimpse
of Eastern life was something, particularly a glimpse
of Eastern life where Eastern life should not be, in a
land which once was European. It is the rule of the
Turk, it is the effect of his four hundred years of
oppression, which makes Trebinje to differ alike from
Tzetinje and from Cattaro. The dark, dingy, narrow,
streets, the dim arches and vaults, the bazaar, with
the Turk&mdash;more truly the renegade Slave&mdash;squatting
in his shop, the gate with its Arabic inscription, the
mosques with their minarets contrasting with the
church with its disused campanile, all come home to
us with a feeling not only of mere strangeness, but
of something which is where it ought not to be. It
is with a feeling of relief that, after our second trudge,
our second voyage, our second meeting with the
convoy, we reach the heights, we pass the guard-houses,
and find ourselves again in Christendom.
Presently Ragusa comes within sight; we are in no
mood to discuss the respective merits of the fallen
aristocratic commonwealths and of the rule of the
Apostolic King. King or Doge or Rector, we may
be thankful for the rule of any of them, so as it be
not the rule of the Sultan. The difference between
four hundred years of civilized government and four
hundred years of barbarian tyranny has made the difference
between Ragusa and Trebinje.</p>

<h3>CATTARO.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">
[I have left this paper, with a few needful corrections, as it was
published in March 1876. Since then, it must be remembered, much
has changed, especially in the way of boundaries&mdash;to say nothing of a
carriage-way to Tzetinje. Neither Cattaro nor Budua is any longer
either the end of Christendom or the end of the Dalmatian kingdom
of the Austrian. That kingdom has been enlarged by the harbour of
Spizza, won from the Turk by Montenegrin valour and won from the
Montenegrin by Austrian diplomacy. But Christendom must now be
looked on as enlarged by the whole Montenegrin sea-coast, a form of
words which I could not have used either in 1875 or in 1877. Of this
sea-coast I shall have something to say in another paper.]</p>

<p>The end of a purely Dalmatian pilgrimage will be
Cattaro. He who goes further along the coast will
pass into lands that have a history, past and present,
which is wholly distinct from that of the coast which
he has hitherto traced from Zara&mdash;we might say from
Capo d'Istria&mdash;onwards. We have not reached the
end of the old Venetian dominion&mdash;for that we must
carry on our voyage to Crete and Cyprus. But we
have reached the end of the nearly continuous
Venetian dominion&mdash;the end of the coast which, save
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
at two small points, was either Venetian or Ragusan&mdash;the
end of that territory of the two maritime commonwealths
which they kept down to their fall in
modern times, and in which they have been succeeded
by the modern Dalmatian kingdom. After Cattaro
and the small district of Budua beyond it, the Venetian
territory did indeed once go on continuously as far as
Epidamnos, Dyrrhachion, or Durazzo, while, down to
the fall of the Republic, it went on, in the form of
scattered outposts, much farther. But, for a long time
past, Venice had held beyond Budua only islands and
outlying points; and most of these, except the seven
so-called Ionian Islands and a few memorable points
on the neighbouring mainland, had passed away from
her before her fall. Cattaro is the last city of the
present Austrian dominion; it is, till we reach the
frontier of the modern Greek kingdom, the last city
of Christendom. The next point at which the steamer
stops will land the traveller on what is now Turkish
ground. But the distinction is older than that; he
will now change from a Slavonic mainland with a half-Italian
fringe on its coast to an Albanian, that is an
Old-Illyrian, land, with a few points here and there
which once came under Italian influences. It is not
at an arbitrary point that the dominion in which the
Apostolic King has succeeded the Serene Republic
comes to an end. With Cattaro then the Dalmatian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
journey and the series of Dalmatian cities will
naturally end.</p>

<p>Cattaro is commonly said to have been the Ascrivium
or Askrourion of Pliny and Ptolemy, one of the
Roman towns which Pliny places after Epidauros&mdash;that
Epidauros which was the parent of Ragusa&mdash;towards
the south-east. And, as it is placed between
Rhizinion and Butua, which must be Risano and
Budua, one can hardly doubt that the identification
is right. But though Ascrivium is described as a
town of Roman citizens, it has not, like some of its
neighbours, any history in purely Roman times. It
first comes into notice in the pages of Constantine
Porphyrogenitus, and it will therefore give us for the
last time the privilege of studying topography in
company with an Emperor. In his pages the city bears
a name which is evidently the same as the name which
it bears still, but which the august geographer seizes
on as the subject of one of his wonderful bits of etymology.
Cattaro with him is Dekatera, and we read:</p>

<p><span class="greek" title="hoti to kastron tôn Dekaterôn hermêneuetai tê
Rhômaiôn dialektô estenômenon kai peplêgmenon.">&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#916;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#7953;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#8135;

<p>We are again driven to ask, Which is the dialect
of the Romans? What word either of Greek or
of Latin can the Emperor have got hold of? At
the same time he had got a fair notion of the
general position of Cattaro, though he runs off into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
bits of exaggeration which remind us of Giraldus'
description of Llanthony. The city stands at the end
of an inlet of the sea fifteen or twenty miles long, and
it has mountains around it so high that it is only in
fair summer weather that the sun can be seen; in
winter Dekatera never enjoys his presence. There
certainly is no place where it is harder to believe
that the smooth waters of the narrow, lake-like inlet,
with mountains on each side which it seems as if one
could put out one's hand and touch, are really part
of the same sea which dashes against the rocks of
Ragusa. They end in a meadow-like coast which
makes one think of Bourget or Trasimenus rather
than of Hadria. The Dalmatian voyage is well
ended by the sail along the <i>Bocche</i>, the loveliest piece
of inland sea which can be conceived, and whose
shores are as rich in curious bits of political history
as they are in scenes of surpassing natural beauty.
The general history of the district consists in the
usual tossing to and fro between the various powers
which have at different times been strong in the
neighbourhood. Cattaro&mdash;<span class="greek" title="ta katô Dekatera">&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#940;&#964;&#969; &#916;&#949;&#954;&#940;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945;</span>&mdash;was in
the reign of Basil the Macedonian besieged and taken
by Saracens, who presently went on unsuccessfully to
besiege Ragusa. And, as under Byzantine rule it
was taken by Saracens, so under Venetian rule it
was more than once besieged by Turks. In the intermediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
stages we get the usual alternations of
independence and of subjection to all the neighbouring
powers in turn, till in 1419 Cattaro finally
became Venetian. At the fall of the Republic it
became part of the Austrian share of the spoil. When
the spoilers quarrelled, it fell to France. When
England, Russia, and Montenegro were allies, the
city joined the land of which it naturally forms the
head, and Cattaro became the Montenegrin haven and
capital. When France was no longer dangerous, and
the powers of Europe came together to part out other
men's goods, Austria calmly asked for Cattaro back
again, and easily got it. To this day the land keeps
many signs of the endless changes which it has undergone.
We enter the mouth of the gulf, where, eighty
years ago, the land was Ragusan on the left hand and
Venetian on the right. But Ragusa and Venice
between them did not occupy the whole shore of the
<i>Bocche</i>; neither at this day does the whole of it
belong to that Dalmatian kingdom which has taken
the place of both the old republics. We soon reach
the further of the two points where Ragusan jealousy
preferred an infidel to a Christian neighbour. At
Sutorina the Turkish territory nominally comes down
to the sea; nominally we say, for if the soil belongs
to the Sultan, the road, the most important thing upon
it, belongs to the Dalmatian King. And if the Turk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
comes down to the <i>Bocche</i> at this end, at the other
end the Montenegrin, if he does not come down to
the water, at least looks down upon it. In this
furthest corner of Dalmatia political elements, old and
new, come in which do not show themselves at Zara
and Spalato. In short, on the <i>Bocche</i> we have really
got into another region, national and religious, from
the nearer parts of the country. We have hitherto
spoken of an Italian fringe on a Slavonic mainland;
we might be tempted to speak of Italian cities with a
surrounding Slavonic country. On the shores of the
<i>Bocche</i> we may drop those forms of speech. We can
hardly say that here there is so much as an Italian
fringe. We feel at last we have reached the land
which is thoroughly Slavonic. The <i>Bocchesi</i> at once
proclaim themselves as the near kinsmen of the unconquered
race above them, from whom indeed they
differ only in the accidents of their political history.
For all purposes but those of war and government,
Cattaro is more truly the capital of Montenegro
than Tzetinje. In one sense indeed Cattaro is more
Italian than Ragusa. All Ragusa, though it has an
Italian varnish, is Slavonic at heart. At Cattaro it
would be truer to speak of a Slavonic majority and an
Italian minority. And along these coasts, together
with this distinct predominance of the Slavonic
nationality, we come also, if not to the predominance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
at all events to the greatly increased prominence, of
that form of Christianity to which the Eastern Slave
naturally tends. Elsewhere in Dalmatia, as we have
on the Slavonic body a narrow fringe of Italian speech,
art, and manners, so we have a narrow fringe of the
religion of the Old Rome skirting a body belonging
to the New. Here, along with the Slavonic nationality,
the religion of Eastern Christendom makes itself distinctly
seen. In the city of Cattaro the Orthodox
Church is still in a minority, but it is a minority not
far short of a majority. Outside its walls, the Orthodox
outnumber the Catholics. In short, when we reach
Cattaro, we have very little temptation to fancy ourselves
in Italy or in any part of Western Christendom.
We not only know, but feel, that we are on
the Byzantine side of the Hadriatic; that we have, in
fact, made our way into Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>And East and West, Slave and Italian, New Rome
and Old, might well struggle for the possession of the
land and of the water through which we pass from
Ragusa to our final goal at Cattaro. The strait leads
us into a gulf; another narrow strait leads us into an
inner gulf; and on an inlet again branching out of
that inner gulf lies the furthest of Dalmatian cities.
The lower city, Cattaro itself, <span class="greek" title="ta katô Dekatera">&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#940;&#964;&#969; &#916;&#949;&#954;&#940;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#945;</span>,
seems to lie so quietly, so peacefully, as if in a world
of its own from which nothing beyond the shores of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
its own <i>Bocche</i> could enter, that we are tempted to
forget, not only that the spot has been the scene of
so many revolutions through so many ages, but that
it is even now a border city, a city on the marchland
of contending powers, creeds, and races. But, if we
once look up to the mountains, we see signs both of
the past and of the present, which may remind us of
the true nature and history of the land in which we
are. In some of the other smaller Dalmatian towns,
and at other points along the coast, we see castles
perched on mountain peaks or ledges at a height
which seems almost frightful; but the castle of Cattaro
and the walls leading up to it, walls which seem to
leap from point to point of the almost perpendicular
hill, form surely the most striking of all the mountain
fortresses of the land. The castle is perhaps all the
more striking, nestling as it does among the rocks,
than if it actually stood, like some others, on a peak
or crest of the mountain. One thinks of Alexander's
Aornos, and indeed the name of Aornos might be
given to any of these Dalmatian heights. The lack
of birds, great and small, especially the lack of the
eagles and vultures that one sees in other mountain
lands, is a distinct feature in the aspect of the Dalmatian
hills and of their immediate borders, Montenegrin
and Turkish. But, while the castle stands as
if no human power could reach it, much less fight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
against it, there are other signs of more modern date
which remind us that there are points higher still
where no one can complain that the art of fighting
has been unknown in any age. Up the mountain,
during part of its course skirting the castle walls,
climbs the winding road&mdash;the staircase rather&mdash;which
leads from Cattaro to Tzetinje. On it climbs, up and
up, till it is lost in the higher peaks; long before the
traveller reaches the frontier line which divides Dalmatia
and Montenegro, long before he reaches the
ridge to which he looks up from Cattaro and its gulf,
he has begun to look down, not only on the gulf and
the city, but on the mountain castle itself, as something
lying far below his feet. From below, Cattaro
seems like the end of the world. As we climb the
mountain paths, we soon find that it is but a border
post on the frontier of a vast world beyond it, a world
in whose past history Cattaro has had some share, a
world whose history is not yet over.</p>

<p class="p2">The city of Cattaro itself is small, standing on a
narrow ledge between the gulf and the base of the
mountain. It carries the features of the Dalmatian
cities to what any one who has not seen Traü will call
their extreme point. But, though the streets of Cattaro
are narrow, yet they are civilized and airy-looking
compared with those of Traü, and the little paved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
squares, as so often along this coast, suggest the
memory of the ruling city. The memory of Venice
is again called up by the graceful little scraps of its
characteristic architecture which catch the eye ever
and anon among the houses of Cattaro. The landing-place,
the <i>marina</i>, the space between the coast and the
Venetian wall, where we pass for the last time under
the winged lion over the gate, has put on the air of a
<i>boulevard</i>. But the forms and costume of <i>Bocchesi</i> and
Montenegrins, the men of the gulf, with their arms in
their girdles, no less than the men of the Black Mountain,
banish all thought that we are anywhere but
where we really are, at one of the border points of
Christian and civilized Europe. If in the sons of the
mountains we see the men who have in all ages held
out against the invading Turk, we see in their brethren
of the coast the men who, but a few years back, brought
Imperial, Royal, and Apostolic Majesty to its knees.
The same thought is brought home to us in another
form. The antiquities of Cattaro are mainly ecclesiastical,
and among them the Orthodox church, standing
well in one of the open places, claims a rank
second only to the <i>duomo</i>. Here some may see for
the first time the ecclesiastical arrangements of Eastern
Christendom; and those who do not wish to see a
church thrown wide open from end to end, those who
would cleave alike to the rood-beam of Lübeck, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
<i>jubé</i> of Albi, and the <i>cancelli</i> of Saint Clement, to the
old screen which once was at Wimborne and to the
new screen which now is at Lichfield, may be startled
at the first sight of the Eastern <i>eikonostasis</i> blocking
off apse and altar utterly from sight. The arrangements
of the Eastern Church may indeed be seen
in places much nearer than Cattaro, at Trieste, at
Wiesbaden, in London itself; but in all these places
the Eastern Church is an exotic, standing as a
stranger on Western ground. At Cattaro the Orthodox
Church is on its own ground, standing side by
side on equal terms with its Latin rival, pointing to
lands where the <i>Filioque</i> is unknown and where the
Bishop of the Old Rome has ever been deemed an
intruder. The building itself is a small Byzantine
church, less Byzantine in fact in its outline than the
small churches of the Byzantine type at Zara, Spalato,
and Traü. The single dome rises, not from the intersection
of a Greek cross, but from the middle of
a single body, and, resting as it does on pointed
arches, it suggests the thought of Périgueux and
Angoulême. But this arrangement, which is shared
by a neighbouring Latin church, is well known
throughout the East. The Latin <i>duomo</i>, which has
been minutely described by Mr. Neale, is of quite
another type, and is by no means Dalmatian in its
general look. A modern west front with two western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
towers does not go for much; but it reminds us that a
design of the same kind was begun at Traü in better
times. The inside is quite unlike anything of later
Italian work. It seems like a cross between a basilica
and an Aquitanian church. It is small, but the
inside is lofty and solemn. The body of the church,
not counting the apses and the western portico, has
seven narrow arches, the six eastern ones grouped in
pairs forming, as in so many German examples, three
bays only in the vaulting. The principal pillars are
rectangular with flat pilasters; the intermediate piers
are Corinthian columns with a heavy Lucchese abacus,
enriched with more mouldings than is usual at Lucca.
As there is no triforium, and only a blank clerestory,
the whole effect comes from the tall columns and their
narrow arches, the last offshoots of Spalato that we
have to record. For the ecclesiologist proper there
is a prodigious <i>baldacchino</i>, and a grand display of
metal-work behind the high altar. A good deal too,
as Mr. Neale has shown, may be gleaned from the
inscriptions and records. The traveller whose objects
are of a more general kind turns away from this
border church of Christendom as the last stage of a
pilgrimage unsurpassed either for natural beauty or
for historic interest. And, as he looks up at the
mountain which rises almost close above the east end
of the <i>duomo</i> of Cattaro, and thinks of the land and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
the men to which the path over that mountain leads,
he feels that, on this frontier at least, the spirit still
lives which led English warriors to the side of Manuel
Komnênos, and which steeled the heart of the last
Constantine to die in the breach for the Roman name
and the faith of Christendom.

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The solemn yearly marriage between the Venetian
commonwealth and the Hadriatic sea had much more
effect on the eastern shore of that sea than on the
western. On the eastern side of the long gulf there
are few points which have not at some time or other
"looked to the winged lion's marble piles," and for
many ages a long and nearly continuous dominion
looked steadily to that quarter. On the western shore
Venice never established any lasting dominion very
far from her own lagoons. Ravenna was the furthest
point on that side which she held for any considerable
time, and at Ravenna we are hardly clear of the delta
of the Po. In the northern region of Italy her power
struck inland, till at last, defying the precepts of
the wise Doge who could not keep even Treviso, she
held an unbroken dominion from Bergamo to Cividale.
That she kept that dominion down to her fall, that
that dominion could live through the fearful trial of
the League of Cambray, may perhaps show that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Venice, after all, was not so unfitted to become a
land-power as she seems at first sight, and as Andrew
Contarini deemed her in the fourteenth century. Yet
one might have thought that the occupation of this or
that point along the long coast from Ravenna to the
heel of the boot would have better suited her policy
than the lordship over Bergamo and Brescia. And one
might have thought too that, amid the endless changes
that went on among the small commonwealths and
tyrannies of that region, it would have been easier for
the Republic to establish its dominion there than to
establish it over great cities like Padua and Verona.
Yet Venice did not establish even a temporary
dominion along these coasts till she was already a
great land power in Lombardy and Venetia. And
then the few outlying points which she held for a
while lay, not among the small towns of the marches,
but within the solid kingdom which the Norman had
made, and which had passed from him to kings from
Swabia, from Anjou, and from Aragon. It is this
last thought which gives the short Venetian occupation
of certain cities within what the Italians called
<i>the Kingdom</i> a higher interest in itself, and withal
a certain connexion in idea with more lasting possessions
of the commonwealth elsewhere. At Trani
and at Otranto, no less than in Corfu and at Durazzo,
the Venetian was treading in the footsteps of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Norman. Only, on the eastern side of Hadria the
Republic won firm and long possession of places
where the Norman had been seen only for a moment;
on the western side, the Republic held only for a
moment places which the Norman had firmly grasped,
and which he handed on to his successors of other
races. And, if we pass on from the Norman himself
to those successors, we shall find the connexion
between the Venetian dominion on the eastern and the
western side of the gulf become yet stronger. The
Venetian occupation of Neapolitan towns within the
actual Neapolitan kingdom seems less strange, if we
look on it as a continuation of the process by which
many points on the eastern coast had passed to and
fro between the Republic and the Kings of Sicily and
afterwards of Naples. The connexion between Sicily
and southern Italy on the one hand and the coasts
and islands of western Greece on the other, is as old
as the days of the Greek colonies, perhaps as old as
the days of Homer. The singer of the Odyssey seems
to know of Sikels in Epeiros; but, if his Sikels were
in Italy, we only get the same connexion in another
shape. A crowd of rulers from one side and from the
other have ruled on both sides of the lower waters of
Hadria. Agathoklês, Pyrrhos, Robert Wiscard, King
Roger, William the Good, strove alike either to add
Epeiros and Korkyra to a Sicilian dominion or to add
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Sicily to a dominion which already took in Epeiros
and Korkyra. So did Manfred; so did Charles of
Anjou. And after the division of the Sicilian
kingdom, the kings of the continental realm held a
considerable dominion on the Greek side of the sea.
And that dominion largely consisted of places which
had been Venetian and which were to become
Venetian again. To go no further into detail, if we
remember that Corfu and Durazzo were held by
Norman Dukes and Kings of Apulia and Sicily&mdash;that
they were afterwards possessions of Venice&mdash;that
they were possessions of the Angevin kings at Naples,
and then possessions of Venice again&mdash;it may perhaps
seem less wonderful to find the Republic at a later
time occupying outposts on the coasts of the
Neapolitan kingdom itself.</p>

<p>It was not till the last years of the fifteenth
century, when so many of her Greek and Albanian
possessions had passed away, that the Republic
appeared as a ruler on the coasts of Apulia and of
that land of Otranto, the heel of the boot, from which
the name of Calabria had long before wandered to the
toe. It was in 1495, when Charles of France went
into southern Italy to receive for himself a kingdom
and to return,&mdash;only to return without the kingdom,&mdash;that
the Venetians, as allies of his rival Ferdinand,
took the town of Monopoli by storm, and one or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
smaller places by capitulation. What they took they
kept, and in the next year their ally pledged to them
other cities, among them Trani, Brindisi, Otranto,
and Taranto, in return for help in men and money.
These cities were thus won by Venice as the ally of the
Aragonese King against the French. But at a later
time, when France and Aragon were allied against
Venice, the Aragonese King of the Sicilies, a more
famous Ferdinand than the first, took them as his
share in 1509. We cannot wonder at this; no king,
or commonwealth either, can be pleased to see a string
of precious coast towns in the hands of a foreign power.
Again in 1528 Venice is allied with France against
Aragon and Naples, and Aragon and Naples are now
only two of the endless kingdoms of Charles of Austria.
For a moment the lost cities are again Venetian. Two
years later, as part of the great pageant of Bologna,
they passed back from the rule of Saint Mark to the
last prince who ever wore the crown of Rome.</p>

<p>So short an occupation cannot be expected to have
left any marked impress on the cities which Venice
thus held for a few years at a late time as isolated
outposts. These Apulian towns are not Venetian in
the same sense in which the Istrian and Dalmatian
towns are. In those regions, even the cities which
were merely neighbours and not subjects of Venice
may be called Venetian in an artistic sense; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
were in some sort members of a body of which
Venice was the chief. Here we see next to nothing
which recalls Venice in any way. The difference is
most likely owing, not so much in the late date at which
these towns became Venetian possessions, as to the
shortness of time by which they were held, and to the
precarious tenure by which the Republic held them.
As far as mere dates go, Cattaro and Trani were won
by Venice within the same century. But, as we have
seen, the architectural features which give the
Dalmatian towns their Venetian character belong to
the most part to times even later than the occupation
of Trani. Men must have gone on building at
Cattaro in the Venetian fashion for fully a century
and a half after Trani was again lost by Venice.
There are few Venetian memorials to be seen in these
towns; and if the winged lion ever appeared over their
gates, he has been carefully thrust aside by kings and
emperors. More truly perhaps, kings and emperors
rebuilt the walls of these towns after the Venetian
power had passed away. Still the occupation of these
towns forms part of Venetian history, and they may
be visited so as to bring them within the range of
Venetian geography. Brindisi is the natural starting
point for Corfu and the Albanian coast, and Brindisi is
one of the towns which Venice thus held for a season.
The two opposite coasts are thus brought into direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
connexion. The lands which owned, first the Norman
and the Angevin, and then the Venetian, as their
masters, may thus naturally become part of a single
journey. We may have passed through the hilly lands,
we may have seen the hill-cities, of central Italy; we
may have gone through lands too far from the sea to
suggest any memories of Venice, but which are full of
the memories of the Norman and the Swabian. We
find ourselves in the great Apulian plain, the great
sheep-feeding plain so memorable in the wars of
Anjou and Aragon, and we tarry to visit some of
the cities of the Apulian coast. The contrast indeed
is great between the land in which we are and either
the land from which we have come, or the land
whither we are going. Bari, Trani, and their fellows,
planted on the low coast where the great plain joins
the sea, are indeed unlike, either the Latin and
Volscian towns on their hill-tops, or the Dalmatian
towns nestling between the sea and the mountains.
The greatest of these towns, the greatest at least in
its present state, never came under Venetian rule.
Bari, the city which it needed the strength of both
Empires to win from the Saracen, is said to have been
defended by a Venetian fleet early in the eleventh
century, when Venetian fleets still sailed at the
bidding of the Eastern Emperor. Further than this,
we can find few or no points of connexion between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Venice and these cities, till their first occupation at
the end of the fifteenth century. But that short
occupation brings them within our range. We are
passing, it may be, from Benevento to fishy Bari, as
two stages of the "iter ad Brundisium." Thence we
may go on, in the wake of so many travellers and
conquerors, to those lands beyond the sea where the
Lords of one-fourth and one-eighth of the Empire of
Romania, and the Norman lords of Apulia and Sicily,
the conquerors of Corfu and Albania, were alike at
home. Between Benevento and Bari the eye is caught
by the great tower of Trani. Such a city cannot be
passed by; or, if we are driven to pass it by, we must
go back to get something more than a glimpse of it.
And Trani is one of the towns pledged to Venice by
Ferdinand of Naples. In the midst of cities whose
chief memories later than old Imperial times carry us
back to the Norman and Swabian days of the eleventh,
twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, we find ourselves
suddenly plunged into the Venetian history of the
end of the fifteenth.</p>

<p class="p2">Trani then will be our introduction to the group of
towns with which we are at present concerned. At
the present moment, it is undoubtedly the foremost
among them; but it is hard to call up any distinct
memory of its history till we reach the times which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
made it for a moment a Venetian possession. Trani,
like other places, doubtless has its history known to
local inquirers; but the more general inquirer will
very seldom light upon its name. It is hard to find
any sure sign of its being in Roman times, but it must
be the "Tirhennium quæ et Trana" of the geographer
Guido. Let us take such a common-place test as looking
through the indices to several volumes of Muratori and
Pertz till the task becomes wearisome. Such a task will
show us the name of Trani here and there, but only
here and there. We do by searching find it mentioned
in the days of King Roger and in the days of the
Emperor Lothar, but it is only by searching that we
find it. The name of Trani does not stand out without
searching, like so many of the cities even of southern
Italy. Yet Trani is no inconsiderable place; it is an
archæpiscopal see with a noble metropolitan church;
and in our own day, though much smaller than its
neighbour Bari, it seems to share in the present
prosperity of which the signs at Bari are unmistakeable.
The visitor to Trani will find much to see there,
but he will not find the stamp of Venice on the city.
Trani, like its fellows, had received its distinctive
character long before it had to do with Venice, and
that character was not one that was at all marked by
Venetian influences. The city is not without Venetian
monuments; the memory of its Venetian days is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
forgotten even in its modern street nomenclature.
There is a <i>Piazza Gradenigo</i>, and an inscription near
one of the later churches records the name of Giuliano
Gradenigo as the Venetian governor of Trani in 1503,
and as having had a hand in its building. The castle
might be suspected of containing work of the days of
the Republic; but a threatening man of the sword
forbids any study of its walls even with a distant
spy-glass; not however till the chief inscription has
been read, and has been found to belong to days later
than those of Venetian rule. There is no knowing what
may not happen to places when they have once fallen
into the hands of soldiers; to the civilian mind it might
seem that, when a king writes up an inscription to
record his buildings, he wishes that inscription to be
read of all men for all time. It is hard too to see
how an antiquary's spy-glass can do anything to
help prisoners confined within massive walls to break
forth, as Italian&mdash;at least Sicilian&mdash;prisoners sometimes
know how to break forth. The metropolitan
church of Trani is happily not in military hands;
neither are the streets and lanes of the city, the
houses, the smaller churches, the arcades by the haven,
the buildings of the town in general. All these
may therefore be studied without let or hindrance;
civil officials, even cloistered nuns, see no danger to
Church or State if the stranger draws the outside of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
a window or copies an inscription on an outer wall.
But though we may find at Trani bits of work which
might have stood in Venice, it is only as they might
have stood in any other city of Italy. There is
nothing in Trani, besides the memorial of Gradenigo,
which brings the Serene Republic specially before the
mind. The great church, the glory of Trani, bears
the impress of that mixed style of art which is characteristic
of Norman rule in Apulia, but which is
quite different from anything to be found in Norman
Sicily. It has some points in common with its neighbours
at Bitonto and Bari, and some points very
distinctive of itself. It is undoubtedly one of the
noblest churches of its own class. If we were to call
it one of the noblest churches of Christendom, the
phrase would be misleading, because, to an English
ear at least, it would suggest the thought of something
on a much greater scale, something more nearly approaching
the boundless length of an English minster
or the boundless height of a French one. In southern
Italy bishops and archbishops were so thick upon the
ground that even a metropolitan church was not likely
to reach, in point of mere size, to the measure of a
second-class cathedral or conventual church in England
or even in Normandy. But mere size is not everything,
and, as an example of a particular form of
Romanesque, as an example of difficulties ably grappled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
with and thoroughly overcome, the church of
Trani might almost claim to rank beside the church
of Pisa and the church of Durham. And higher
praise than that no building can have.</p>

<p>Fully to take in the effect of this grand church, it
will be well not to hurry towards it on reaching the
city. Go straight from the railway-station towards
another bell-tower, not to that of the <i>duomo</i>. That
course will lead to the so-called <i>villa</i> or public garden.
The suppressed Dominican convent close by its gate
has no attractive feature except its tower, one of the
usual Italian type, only with pointed arches. But the
grounds of the <i>villa</i>, raised on the ancient walls of the
monastic precinct, look down at once on the waves of
Hadria. In the northern view we look out on lands
and hills beyond the water; but no man must dream
that the eastern peninsula of Europe is to be seen
from Trani. We look out only over the gulf of Manfredonia&mdash;the
name of the Hohenstaufen king is as
it were stamped upon the waters&mdash;to the Italian peninsula
of Mount Garganus. Hence, on our way to the
metropolitan church, we pass by the basin which
forms the haven of Trani, a basin which reminds
us of the <i>cala</i> which is all that is left of the many
waters of Palermo. The distant view clearly brings
out its main outline; above all, it brings out those
arrangements of the eastern end which form the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
characteristic feature. We see the tall tower at the
south-west corner; we see the line of the clerestory
with its small round-headed windows; above all, we
see&mdash;so unlike anything in Northern architecture&mdash;the
tall transept seeming to soar far above the rest of the
church, with the three apses, strangely narrow and
lofty, treated simply, as it would seem, as appendages
to the transept itself. Those who have not seen
Bitonto and Bari will not guess how great a danger
these soaring apses have escaped. The Norman of
Apulia did not, like the native Italian, deal in detached
bell-towers; he clave to the use of his native
land which made the tower or towers an integral part
of the church. But he seems to have specially chosen
a place for them which is German rather than Norman,
and then to have treated them in a way which is
neither German, Norman, nor Italian. At Bitonto
and in the two great churches of Bari, a pair of towers
flanks the east end. In Italy it might be safer to say
the apse end; but we think that in all these cases the
apse end is the east end or nearly so. Such pairs of
eastern towers are common in Germany; but there
the great apse projects between them. At Bari and
Bitonto the whole apsidal arrangement is masked by
a flat wall. The towers rise above the side apses;
the great central apse is hidden by the wall carried in
front of it. We thus get at the east end a flat front,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
like a west front; we lose the curves of the apses, and
with them the arcades and grouped windows which
form so marked a feature in the ordinary Romanesque
of Germany and Italy. A single window, of larger
size than Romanesque taste commonly allows, marks
the place of the high altar. And this window is
adorned with shafts and mouldings of special richness,
and with animal figures above and below the shafts.
Now here at Trani, though all the apses stand out, yet
a like arrangement is followed. The central apse has
only a single window of the same enriched type; the
side apses have also only a single window each, but of
a much plainer kind. Thus much, without taking in
every detail, we can mark in our distant view; we can
mark too somewhat of the unusually rich and heavy
cornice of the transept, and the upper part of the
transept front, the wheel window and the two rich
coupled windows beneath it. We can mark too the
arrangements of the great square tower, crowned with
its small octagonal finish; and even here we can see
that, with all its majesty of outline, it is far from
ranking in the first class of Italian bell-towers. Its
composition lacks boldness and simplicity, while it
has nothing remarkable in the way of ornament.
Saint Zeno among the simpler towers, Spalato among
the more elaborate, stand indeed unrivalled. But the
cathedral tower of Trani, when closely examined, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
less satisfactory than its own majestic neighbour at
Bari. It is not merely that the pointed arch, always
out of place in an Italian bell-tower, is used in the
upper stages. The pointed arch is used with better
effect, both far away in the noble tower of Velletri,
and close by at Trani itself, in the far humbler
tower of the Dominican church. The fault lies in
this, that the windows, instead of being spread over
the whole face of each stage, are gathered together in
the centre of each, while two of them have rather
awkward pointed canopies over the groups of windows.
Still, seen from far or near, it is a grand and majestic
tower, though its faults, which catch the eye at a
distance, become more distinct as we draw nearer.</p>

<p>The road by which we approach the <i>duomo</i> will give
us no view of it from the west, and, till we come quite
near to the church, we shall hardly see how closely it
overhangs the sea. We take our course by the harbour,
for part of the way is under heavy and dark arcades
which remind us of Genoa. Presently, before we reach
the great church, we come across the east end of a
smaller one, with which we shall afterwards become
better acquainted from its western side. At this end
it seems to be called <i>Purgatorio</i>; at the other end we
shall find that its true name is <i>Ogni Santi</i>&mdash;All Hallows.
Here there is no transept; still the three apses
may pass for a miniature of those in the metropolitan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
church; there is the same single large and elaborate
window in the mid apse, the same smaller single
windows in the side apses. We go landwards for a
short way, and we presently find ourselves on a terrace
overlooking the sea, close under the east end of the
<i>duomo</i>. We now better take in both the grandeur and
the singularity of the building whose general effect we
have studied from a distance. We take in some fresh
features, as the tall blank arcades along the walls, a
feature shared by Trani with Bari, and we guess that
the extraordinary height of the apses must be owing
to the presence of a lofty under-church. We see signs
too at the east end which seem to show that at some
time or other there was a design for some other form
of east end, inconsistent with the present design. The
visitor will now perhaps be tempted to go at once
within, though he ought in strictness to pass under the
tower in order to finish his outside survey at the west
end. It is curious to see how the same feeling which
prevails in the east end prevails in the west front also.
Here we have no continuous arcades like Pisa, Lucca,
and Zara&mdash;happily we have no sham gables like the
great one at Lucca; we have again the single great
window with the small ones on each side. Only here
the mid window has over it a rich wheel, the favourite
form of the country, a form which the apsidal east end
would not allow. And it is treated in exactly the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
way, with the same kind of surrounding ornaments, as
the single-light windows.</p>

<p>This west front, as it now stands, has a rather bare
look; the windows have too much the air of being cut
through the wall without any artistic design, and
there is too great a gap between the windows and the
west doorway with its flanking arcades below. But
this last fault at least is not to be charged on the
original design, which clearly took in a projecting
portico. We may doubt however whether the portico
could have been high enough to have much dignity,
and we shall find this feature far more skilfully treated
in the other smaller church of which we have already
spoken. And here we must confess that it is possible
to make two visits to Trani, and each time to make a
somewhat careful examination of its great church, and
yet to miss&mdash;not at all to forget to look for, but to fail
to find&mdash;the bronze doors which form one of the
wonders of Trani. This may seem incredible at a
distance; it will be found on the spot not to be
wonderful. We will not describe the doors at second-hand;
we will rather hasten within to gaze on the
surpassing grandeur of an interior, which, as an
example of architectural design, may, as we have
already hinted, rank beside the church by the Arno
and the church by the Wear, beside the Conqueror's
abbey at Caen and King Roger's chapel at Palermo.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>We say King Roger's chapel advisedly; for the
palace chapel of Palermo, were every scrap of its
gorgeous mosaics whitewashed over, would still rank,
simply as an architectural design, among the most
successful in the world. And the chapel of Palermo
has points which at once suggest comparison and
contrast with the great church of Trani. We see
the traces of the Saracen in both; but at Palermo
the building itself is thoroughly Saracenic, at Trani
the Saracen contributes only one element among
others. In Sicily, where the Saracen was thoroughly
at home, the Norman kings simply built their churches
and palaces in the received style of the island, a
style of which the pointed arch was a main feature.
In southern Italy, where the Saracen was only an occasional
visitor, a style arose in which elements from
Normandy itself&mdash;elements, that is, perhaps brought
first of all from northern Italy&mdash;are mixed with other
elements to be found on the spot, Italian, Saracenic,
and Byzantine. The churches of Bari, Bitonto, and
Trani, all show this mixture in different shapes. One
feature of it is to take the detached Italian bell-tower,
and to make it, Norman fashion, part of the church
itself. In such cases the general character of the
tower is kept, but Norman touches are often brought
into the details; for instance, the common Norman
coupled window, such as we are used to in Normandy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
and England, often displaces the &oelig;cumenical <i>mid-wall</i>
shaft which the older England shared with Italy.
Thus here at Trani, the tower joins the church, though
it is not made so completely part of its substance as
it is at Bari and Bitonto. The inside of the church
shows us another form of the same tendency. The
Norman in Apulia could hardly fail to adopt the
columnar forms of the land in which he was settled;
but he could not bring himself to give up the threefold
division of height and the bold triforium of his own
land. An upper floor was not unknown in Italy, as we
see in more than one of the Roman churches, as in
Saint Agnes, Saint Laurence, and the church known as
<i>Quattro Coronati</i>, to say nothing of Modena and Pisa,
and <i>Sta. Maria della Pieve</i> at Arezzo. But in some of
these cases the arrangement is widely different from
the genuine Norman triforium, and the threefold
division certainly cannot be called characteristically
Italian, any more than characteristically Greek. But
it is characteristically Norman; and when we find it
systematically appearing in churches built under
Norman rule, we must set it down as a result of special
Norman taste. At Trani each of the seven arches of
the nave has a triplet of round arches over it, and a
single clerestory window above that. The Norman in
his own land would have made more of the clerestory;
he would have drawn a string underneath it to part it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
off from the triforium; he would have carried up shafts
to the roof to mark the division into bays. But the
triforium itself, as it stands at Trani, might have been
set up at Caen or Bayeux, with only the smallest
changes in detail. But where in Normandy, where in
England, where, we may add, in Sicily, is there anything
at all like the arcades which in the church of
Trani support this all but thoroughly Norman triforium?
These have no fellow at Bitonto; they have
hardly a fellow at Bari. In those cities the Norman
adopted the columnar arcades of the basilica, while in
Sicily the Saracen still at his bidding placed the pointed
arch on the Roman column. At Trani too we see the
work, or at least the influence, of the Saracen; but it
takes quite another form. The pointed arch would
have been out of place; in Normandy and England it is
ever a mark of the coming Gothic, and there is certainly
no sign of coming Gothic at Trani. But the
coupling of two columns with their capitals under a
single abacus&mdash;sometimes rather a bit of entablature&mdash;to
form the support of an arch, is a well-known Saracenic
feature. Not that it was any Saracen invention.
In architecture, as in everything else, the Saracen was,
as regards the main forms, only a pupil of Rome, Old
and New; but, exactly like the Norman, he knew how
to develope and to throw a new character into the
forms which he borrowed. The coupled columns may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
truly be called a Saracenic feature, though the Saracen
must have learned it in the first instance from such
buildings as the sepulchral church known as Saint
Constantia at Rome. We may fairly see a Saracenic
influence in a crowd of Christian examples where this
form is used in cloisters and other smaller buildings
where the arches and columns are of no great size. It
is even not uncommon in strictly Norman buildings
in positions where the shafts are merely part of
the decorative construction, and do not actually support
the weight of the building. It was a bolder risk
to take a pair of such columns, and bid them bear up
the real weight of the three stages of what we may
fairly call a Norman minster.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="i352" id="i352"></a>
<img src="images/i352.jpg" width="447" height="600" alt="Cathedral, Trani" />
<p class="caption">CATHEDRAL, TRANI, INSIDE.</p>
</div>

<p>But the daring attempt is thoroughly successful;
there is not, what we might well have looked for, any
feeling of weakness; the twin columns yoked together
to bear all that would have been laid on the massive
round piers of England or their square fellows of
Germany, seem fully equal to their work. It may be
that the appearance of strength is partly owing to
the use of real half-columns, and not mere slender
vaulting-shafts, to support the roofs of the aisles.
But the slender shaft comes in with good effect to
support both the arch between the nave and the
transept, and the arch between the transept and the
great apse. The lofty transept is wholly an Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
idea; but the general idea of these two tall arches is
thoroughly Norman.</p>

<p>In looking at such a church as this, so widely
different from any of the many forms with which we
are already familiar, there is always a certain doubt as
to our own feelings. We admire; as to that there is
no doubt. But how far is that admiration the result
of mere wonder at something which in any case is
strange and striking? how far is it a really intelligent
approval of beauty or artistic skill? Both feelings, we
may be pretty sure, come in; but it is not easy to say
which is the leading one, till we are better acquainted
with the building than we are likely to become in an
ordinary journey. It is familiarity which is the real
test. It is the building which we admire as much the
thousandth time as the first which really approves
itself to our critical judgement. We have not seen
Trani for the thousandth time; but we did what we
could; we were so struck with a first visit to Trani that,
at the cost of some disturbance of travelling arrangements,
we went there again, and we certainly did not
admire it less the second time than the first. And,
whatever may be the exact relation of the two feelings
of mere wonder and of strictly critical approval, it is
certain that a third feeling comes in by no means
small a measure. This is a kind of feeling of historic
fitness. The church of Trani is the kind of church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
which ought to have been built by Normans building
on Apulian ground, with Greek and Saracen skill at
their disposal.</p>

<p>But at Trani, as commonly in these Apulian churches,
it is not enough to look at the building from above
ground. The great height of the apses will have already
suggested that there is a lower building of no small
size; and so we find it, conspicuously tall and stately,
even in this land of tall and stately under-churches&mdash;crypt
is a word hardly worthy of them. The under-church
at Trani shows us a forest of tall columns, some
of them fluted, with a vast variety of capitals of foliage.
A few only can be called classical; some have the
punched ornament characteristic of Ravenna. A good
many of the bases have leaves at the corners, a fashion
which in England is commonly a mark of the thirteenth
century, but which in Sicily and Dalmatia
goes on at least till the seventeenth.</p>

<p class="p2">But the metropolitan church is not all that Trani has
to show. In some of the buildings which we pass by in
its narrow streets, we see some good windows of the
style which it is most easy to call Venetian, though it
might be rash hastily to refer them to the days of
Venetian occupation. And there are other windows
seemingly of earlier date, certainly of earlier character,
which bear about them signs of the genuine Norman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
impress. But the strength of Trani, even setting
aside the great church, lies in its ecclesiastical
buildings; the best pieces even of domestic work are
found in one of the monasteries. Two smaller churches
deserve notice; one of them deserves special notice.
This is the church of All Saints, of which we saw the
east end on our way to the great minster, and on
whose west end we shall most likely light as we come
away from it. That west end is covered by a portico,
or rather something more than a portico, as it contains
a double row of arches. The front to the street forms
part of a long and picturesque range of building, of
which the actual arcade consists of four arches. One
only of these is pointed, and that is the only one which
rests on a column, the others being supported by
square piers. But beyond this outer range, the vaulted
approach to the church displays a grand series of
columns and half-columns, with capitals of various
forms. One is of extraordinary grandeur, with the
volutes formed of crowned angels; the forms of the
man and the eagle, either of them good for a volute,
are here pressed into partnership. Within, the church
is a small but graceful basilica, which, notwithstanding
some disfigurements in 1853 which are boastfully
recorded, pretty well keeps its ancient character, its
columns with their capitals of foliage. He who visits
Trani will doubtless also visit Bari, and such an one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
will do well both to compare the great church of Trani
with the two great churches of Bari, and to compare and
contrast this smaller building with the smaller church
at Bari, that of Saint Gregory. Besides this little
basilica, Trani possesses, not in one of its narrow streets,
but in its widest <i>piazza</i>, a church, now of Saint Francis,
but which, among many disfigurements, still keeps the
form of the Greek cross within, and some Romanesque
fragments without. Here, as also at Bari and at
Bitonto, oriental influences&mdash;something we mean more
oriental than Greeks or even than Sicilian Saracens&mdash;may
be seen in the pierced tracery with which some
of the windows are filled. In these cases this kind of
work suggests a mosque; with other details, it might
have carried our thoughts far away, to the great towers
of the West of England.</p>

<p class="p2">Among the other members of this group of cities we
might have expected to find Brindisi, so famous as a
haven of the voyager in Roman days, and no less
famous in our own, fill a high, if not the highest,
place among its fellows. And Brindisi has its points
of interest also, one of them of an almost unique
interest. Over the haven rises a commemorative
column&mdash;its fellow has left only its pedestal&mdash;which
records, not the dominion of Saint Mark, but the
restoration of the city by the Protospatharius Lupus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Is this he whose name has been rightly or wrongly
added to certain annals of Bari? Anyhow there the
column stands, one of the few direct memorials of
Byzantine rule in Italy. There is the round church
also, the mosaic in the otherwise worthless cathedral,
and one or two fragments of domestic work. The lie
of the city and its haven is truly a sight to be studied;
we see that in whatever language it is that <i>Brentesion</i>
means a stag's horn, the name was not unfittingly
given to the antler-like fiords of this little inland sea.
We trace out too the walls of Charles the Fifth, and
we see how Brindisi has shrunk up since his day.
But we are perhaps tempted to do injustice to Brindisi,
to hurry over its monuments, when we are driven to
choose between Brindisi and the greater attractions of
the furthest city of our group, in some sort the furthest
city of Europe. We pass by Lecce, which lies outside
our group, as between Trani and Brindisi we have
been driven to pass Monopoli, the spot which saw the
first beginnings of the short Venetian rule in these
parts. Everything cannot be seen, and we shall
hardly regret sacrificing something to hasten to a spot
which may well call itself the end of the world, and
which forms the most fitting link between the central
and the eastern peninsulas of Europe.</p>

<h3>OTRANTO.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>
<h4>1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Hydrous, Hydruntum, Otranto, has as good a claim
as a city can well have to be looked on as the end of
the world. It is very nearly the physical end of the
world in that part of the world with which it has most
concern. When we have reached Otranto, we can go
no further by any common means of going. It may pass
for the south-eastern point of the peninsula of Italy:
it is the point where that central peninsula comes
nearest to the peninsula which lies beyond it. It is
the point where Western and Eastern Europe are
parted by the smallest amount of sea. It has therefore
been in all times one of the main points of
communication between Eastern and Western Europe.
The old Hydrous appears as a Greek colony, placed,
as one of the old geographers happily puts it, on the
mouth either of the Hadriatic or of the Ionian sea.
Hydruntum appears in Roman days as a rival route
to Brundisium for those who wish to pass from Italy
into Greece. A city so placed naturally plays its part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
in the wars of Belisarius and in the wars of Roger.
Held by the Eastern Emperors as long as they held
anything west of the Hadriatic, it passed, when the
Norman came, into the hands of Apulian Dukes and
Sicilian Kings, and it remained part of the continental
Sicilian kingdom, save for the two moments in its
history which bring it within our immediate range.
Otranto is the one city of Western Europe in which
the Turk has really reigned, though happily for a
moment only. It is one of the cities in this corner of
Italy which formed, for a somewhat longer time, outlying
posts of Venetian dominion; and it is a spot
where the memory of the Turk and the memory of the
Venetian are mingled together in a strange, an unusual,
and a shameful way. In most of the other spots which
have seen the presence of the Turk and the Venetian,
the commonwealth which was the temple-keeper of the
Evangelist shows itself only in its nobler calling, as
"Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite." At Otranto,
Venice appears in a character which is more commonly
taken by the Most Christian King. Before Francis
and Lewis had conspired with the barbarian against
their Christian rivals, the Serene Republic had already
stirred him up to make havoc of a Christian city.</p>

<p>At Otranto then we finish our journey by land, and
from Otranto, as Otranto is now, we have no means of
continuing it by sea. We cannot sail straight, as men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
did in old times, either to Corfu or to Aulona. To
make our way from the central to the south-eastern
peninsula, we have to make the "iter ad Brundisium"
back again from the other side. It is the natural consequence
of being at the end of the world, that when
we reach the point which holds that place, we have to
go back again. And when we find ourselves at Otranto,
the fact that we are at the end of the world, that we
have reached the end, not only of our actual journey,
but of any possible journey of the same kind, is forcibly
set before us as a kind of symbol. We have come to an
end, to a very marked end, of the great railway system
of central Europe. From any place within that system
we can find our way to Otranto by the power of steam.
Beyond Otranto that power can take us no further;
indeed we have so nearly reached the heel of the boot
that there is not much further to go by the help of
any other power. We are at the end of Italy, at the
end, that is, of the central peninsula of Europe, in a
sense in which we are not even at more distant Reggio.
For Reggio is before all things the way to Sicily, and
Sicily we must allow to be geographically an appendage
to Italy, strongly as we must assert the right of
that great island to be looked on historically in quite
another light. And that at Otranto we have distinctly
reached the end of something is clearly set forth by
the arrangements of the railway station itself. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
rails come to an end; the buildings of the station are
placed, not at the side of the line, but straight across
it, a speaking sign that we can go no further, and
that the thought of taking us further has not entered
the most speculative mind.</p>

<p>At Otranto then we have come to the end of one
of the great divisions of the European world; it is
therefore a fitting point to form a main point of connexion
between that division and another. Otranto and
its neighbourhood are the only points of the central
peninsula from which we can, as a matter of ordinary
course, look across into the eastern peninsula. We say
as a matter of ordinary course. There are Albanian or
Dalmatian heights from which it is said that, in
unusually favourable weather, the Garganian peninsula
may be descried; so it may be that the Garganian
peninsula is favoured back again with occasional
glimpses of south-eastern Europe. But a stay of
even a few hours at Otranto shows that there south-eastern
Europe comes within the gazer's ordinary ken.
It is easy to see that it does not so much need good
weather to show it as bad weather to hinder it from
being shown. Before we reach Otranto, while we are
still on the railway, the mountains of Albania rise
clearly before our eyes; from the hill of Otranto itself
they rise more clearly still. And even to those to
whom those heights are no unfamiliar objects from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
nearer points of view, it is a thrilling and a saddening
thought, when we look forth for the first time from a
land of which every inch belongs to the free and
Christian world, and gaze on the once kindred land that
has passed away from freedom and from Christendom.
From the soil of free Italy we look on shores which
are still left under the barbarian yoke, shores where so
many whose fathers were sharers in the European and
Christian heritage have fallen away to the creed of the
barbarian and to all that that creed brings with it.
On the other hand, it is said that there are more
favourable moments when it is possible to look from
free Italy into free Greece. It is said that, sometimes
perhaps Corfu itself, more certainly the smaller islands
which lie off it to the west, may be seen from the hill
of Otranto. If so, we look out from that one spot of
the central peninsula, from that one spot of the
general western world, where the Turk can be said to
have really ruled, for however short a time, and not
simply to have harried. And we look out on that one
among the many islands which gird the eastern
peninsula, which has gone through many changes and
has bowed to many masters, but where alone the Turk
has never ruled as a master, but has shown himself
only as a momentary besieger.</p>

<p>The Turk then was never lord of Corfu; he was for
a while, though only for a very little while, lord of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Otranto. The winged lion floated over Corfu while
the crescent floated for a season over Otranto. It was
therefore perhaps not wholly unfitting that, for another
somewhat longer season, the winged lion should float
over Corfu and Otranto together. But it was not
in his nobler character that the winged lion floated
over Otranto. It would have been a worthy exploit
indeed, if the arms of Venice, by that time a great
Italian power, had driven out the Turk from his first
lodgement on Italian soil. But instead of Venice
driving the Turk out of Otranto, it was the common
belief of the time that it was Venetian intrigue which
had let him in. Nay more, if there was any truth in
other suspicions of the time, the good old prayer of
our forefathers, which prayed for deliverance from
"Pope and Turk," might well have been put up by
the people of Otranto and all Apulia in the year 1480.
Not only the commonwealth of Venice, but the Holy
Father himself, Pope Sixtus the Fourth, was believed
to be an accomplice in the intrigues which enabled
the infidel to establish himself on the shores of
Italy. A time came, almost within our own day,
when Pope and Turk were really leagued together,
and when the Latin Bishop of the Old Rome owed his
restoration to his seat to the joint help of the Mussulman
Sultan of Constantinople and the Orthodox Tzar
of Moscow. But in the fifteenth century we need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
hardly expect even such a Pope as Sixtus of deliberately
bringing the Turk into Italy. His own interests
both as priest and as prince were too directly
threatened. But it is hard to acquit the Venetian
commonwealth, under the dogeship of Giovanni
Mocenigo, of risking the lasting interests of all Christendom,
and of their own Eastern dominion as part of
it, to serve the momentary calls of a petty Italian
policy. We even read that Venetian envoys worked
on the mind of the Sultan by the argument that it
was the part of the new lord of Constantinople to
assert his claim to all that the older lords of Constantinople
had held east of the Hadriatic. No argument
could be more self-destructive in Venetian
mouths. If the Turk had inherited the rights of
Eastern Cæsar in the Western lands, how cruelly
was Venice defrauding him of a large part of the
rights of the Eastern Cæsar in his own Eastern
lands.</p>

<p class="p2">The conquest of Otranto was the last of the conquests
of him who rightly stands out in Ottoman
history as pre-eminently the Conqueror. The second
Mahomet, he who completed the conquest of Christian
Asia by the taking of Trebizond, who crowned the
work of Ottoman conquest in Europe by the taking
of Constantinople, who by the taking of Euboia dealt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
the heaviest blow to the Venetian power in the
Ægæan, who brought under his power, as a gleaning
after the vintage, the Frank lordship of Attica and
the Greek lordship of Peloponnêsos, in his last days
stretched forth his hand to vex Western Europe as he
had so long vexed Eastern Europe and what was left
of Christian Asia. He was in truth attacking both at
the same time; he won Otranto almost at the moment
when he was beaten back from Rhodes. Each scene
of his warfare illustrates the nature of the Ottoman
power at that moment, how it was by the hands of her
own apostate sons that Christendom was brought into
bondage. Against Rhodes the infidel host was led
by a Greek, against Otranto by an Albanian, both
renegades or sons of renegades. And under the first
Ferdinand of Aragon such was the state of things
in the land which had once been ruled by good
King William that soldiers of the Neapolitan King
were willing to pass into the service of the Turk.
Nay, the inhabitants in general seemed ready to
believe the Turk's promises and to accept his dominion
as likely to be milder than that of their own
stranger king. The invader was his own worst enemy.
A contemporary writer witnesses that the prisoners
taken by Achmet <i>Break-Tooth</i>&mdash;such is said to be
the meaning of his surname <i>Giédek</i>&mdash;pointed out to
him that by his cruelties at Otranto he was losing for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
his master a province which otherwise might have
been won with little effort.</p>

<p>But happily things took another turn. Otranto was
in the Western world what Kallipolis&mdash;the Kallipolis
of the Thracian Chersonêsos&mdash;had been in the Eastern.
It was the first foothold of the barbarian, the gate by
which he seemed likely to open his way to the possession
of the central peninsula of Europe, as he had by
the gate of Kallipolis opened his way to the possession
of the eastern peninsula. Otranto was the last of the
conquests of the great Conqueror; what if he had
been longer-lived? what if the second Bajazet had
deserved the name of Thunderbolt like the first?
Would the threat of the first Sultan have been
carried out, and would the Turk have fed his horse
on the high altar of Saint Peter's? The eastern
peninsula fell by internal division, and the central
peninsula, as his very entrance into it shows, was
fully as divided as the eastern. The French conquests
presently showed how little prepared Italy
was to withstand a vigorous attack, and Mahomet
the Conqueror would have been another kind of
enemy from Charles the Eighth. But all such
dangers were warded off. The Turk still showed
himself once and again in northern Italy, but only
as a momentary plunderer. Otranto remained his
only conquest on Italian ground, and that a conquest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
held for thirteen months only. Alfonso, who bears so
unfavourable a character from other sides, must be at
least allowed the merit of winning back the lost city
for his father's realm. Otranto, and Otranto alone of
Italian cities, belongs to, and heads, the list on which
we inscribe the names of Buda and Belgrade and
Athens and Sofia, on which it may now inscribe the
names of Arta and Larissa, but from which hapless
Jôannina and twice-forsaken Parga are still for a while
shut out.</p>

<p>It was not therefore till the Turk had been driven
out, not until southern Italy had been more thoroughly
but not much more lastingly overrun by the armies of
France, that Otranto passed for a while under the rule
of Venice. The Serene Republic hardly deserved to rule
in a city which she had so lately betrayed; the place
seems never to have recovered from the frightful blow
of the Turkish capture. The town now shows no sign
either of the short Venetian occupation or of the
shorter Turkish occupation. From the side of military
history, this last fact is to be regretted. We
must remember that in that day the Ottomans, pressing
and hiring into their service the best skill of
Europe, were in advance of all other people in all
warlike arts. So Guiccardini remarks that the Turks,
during their short occupation of Otranto, strengthened
the city with works of a kind hitherto unknown in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Italy, and which, as he seems to hint, Italian engineers
would have done well to copy, but did not.
The present fortifications date from the time of Charles
the Fifth. Their extent shows at once how far the
Otranto of his day had shrunk up within the bounds
of the ancient city, and how far again modern Otranto
has shrunk up within the walls of the Emperor. It
is said that, before the Turkish capture, Otranto
numbered twenty-two thousand inhabitants; it has
now hardly above a tenth part of that number. As
the military importance of the place has passed away,
military precautions seemed to have passed away with
it; the castle stands free and open; no sentinel
hinders the traveller from wandering as he will within
its walls. But the traveller will gain little by such
wanderings except the look-out over land and sea.
The town stands close upon the sea, on a small height
with a valley between it and the railway station. It is
entered by a gateway of late date, but of some dignity;
but it is not much that the frowning entrance leads to.
The visitor soon finds that Otranto, which gave its
name of old to the surrounding land, which still
ranks as a metropolitan city, has sunk to little more
than a village. It seems to have had no share in the
revived prosperity of the other towns along this coast.
Its one object of any importance is the metropolitan
church, and this is at once the only monument of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
ancient greatness of the place, and also in a strange
way the chief memorial of its momentary bondage to
the barbarian.</p>

<p class="p2">In order thoroughly to take in the position of the
great church of Otranto in its second character, as a
memorial of bondage and deliverance, it may be well
to pass it by for a moment and to go first to the
castle, and look out on one of the points of view
which it commands. Any local guide will be able
to show the traveller the Hill of the Martyrs. It
stands at no great distance beyond the town, and is
held to mark the site of a pagan temple. There the
Turks, after their capture of the city, did as they have
done in later times. Some eight or nine hundred of
the people of Otranto were massacred. Their bodies
lay unburied so long as the Turk kept possession; on
the recovery of the city, the bodies of the martyrs,
as they were now deemed, were gathered together, and
a special chapel was added to the metropolitan church
to receive them. There they may still be seen, piled
together in cases, with inscriptions telling the story.
There are skulls, legs, arms, bones of every part of the
human body, some still showing the dents of barbarian
weapons, some with barbarian weapons still
cleaving to them. There we look on them, ghastly
witnesses that, neither in their days nor in ours, is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
Æthiopian at all disposed to change his skin or the
leopard his spots. What the Turk did at Otranto
he has done at Batak; he may, if the freak seizes him,
do the like at Jôannina. Only the deeds of Otranto
were at least done by the Turk as a mere outside
barbarian; he was not licensed to do them by the
united voice of Europe. It is only in these latest
times that the Turk has been fully authorized, under
all the sanctions of so-called international right, to
renew at pleasure the deeds of Otranto and of Batak
in lands to which Europe has twice promised freedom.</p>

<p>The martyrs of 1480, their sufferings, their honours,
have made so deep an impression on the mind of
Otranto that the metropolitan basilica has popularly
lost its name of <i>Annunziata</i>, and is more commonly
spoken of as the church of the martyrs. But the
great church of Otranto, the church of the prelate
whose style runs as "archiepiscopus Hydrutinus et
primas Salentinorum," is a building of deep interest
on other grounds. Like so many Italian churches, it
is not very attractive without, nor is there anything
specially to tarry over in its bell-tower. But even
outside we may mark one or two signs of the restoration
which the church underwent after its deliverance
from the Turk. The west window is of that date,
one of those rose-windows to which Italian, and still
more Dalmatian, taste clave so long, even when all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
other mediæval fashions had vanished away. Of the
same date is the north door, showing, like the great
doors at Benevento, the Primate of the Salentines
attended by the bishops and chief abbots of his
province. As we go within, our first feeling is one of
wonder that so much should have lived through the
infidel storm and occupation. But, according to the
usual practice of Mussulman conquerors, the head
church of the city was turned into a mosque; there
was therefore, after the first moment of havoc had
passed by, no temptation on the part of the new
occupants to damage the essential features of a building
which had become a temple of their own worship.
It is therefore not wonderful that the main features of
the basilica are still there, either untouched or most
skilfully restored. Seven arches rise from columns,
perhaps of classical date, with capitals, mostly of
different kinds of foliage, but one of which brings in
human figures, after the type which was so well set in
Caracalla's baths. But a more interesting study is
supplied by the great crypt, or rather under-church.
At Otranto, as in some of its neighbours, the craftsmen
who worked below clearly allowed themselves a
freer choice of forms in the carving of capitals than
they ventured on above ground. The vault of the
under-church rests on ranges of slender columns, with
heavy abaci and with an amazing variety in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
capitals. None perhaps can be called classical; but
very few are simply grotesque. The few that are so
are found&mdash;one does not quite see the reason of the
distinction&mdash;among the half-columns against the walls.
Most of them show various forms of foliage and animal
figures; the old law that almost any kind of man,
beast, or bird, can be pressed to serve as the volute
at the corner of a capital is here most fully carried
out. But the further law, that that duty is most
worthily discharged by the imperial eagle, can be
nowhere better studied than in the Hydrantine under-church.
In some capitals again, especially in the
columns of the apses, the bird of Cæsar is perched as
it were on Byzantine basket-work, clearly showing
which Augustus it was to whom the Salentine Primate
bowed as his temporal lord. Other capitals again
are much simpler, but also savouring of the East; the
plain square block has mere carving on the surface.
Then, of the columns themselves, some are plain, some
are fluted, some are themselves carved out with various
patterns. In short a rich and wonderful variety reigns
in every feature of the under-church of Otranto.</p>

<p>Our comparison of the columns and capitals has
carried us underground; but the really distinctive
feature of the basilica of Otranto is above. Other
churches of southern Italy have wonderful crypts;
none, we may feel sure, has so wonderful a pavement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
And here we do wonder that the Turks did not do
incomparably more mischief than they did do. Some
mischief they did; but the archbishops and canons of
Otranto seem&mdash;perhaps unavoidably&mdash;to have done a
great deal more by destroying or covering the rich
pavement to make room for the furniture of the
church. It would surely be hard to find another
example of a pavement whose design is spread over
the whole ground-floor of a great church. The pictures
are in mosaic, rough mosaic certainly, of the second
half of the twelfth century, when Otranto formed part
of the Sicilian realm, and when that realm was ruled
by William the Bad. Luckily inscriptions in the
pavement itself have preserved to us the exact date,
and the names of the giver and the artist. One tells
us in leonine rimes:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Ex Ionathi donis per dexteram Pantaleonis</p>
<p>Hoc opus insigne est superans impendia digne.</p>
</div>

<p>Another stoops to prose: "Humilis servus Ionathas
Hydruntinus archieps. jussit hoc <span class="overline">o</span>p fieri per manus
Pantaleonis p<span class="overline">r</span>b. Anno ab Incarnatione Dn<span class="overline">i</span> Nr<span class="overline">i</span> Ihu.
Xr<span class="overline">i</span> <span class="s08">MCLXV</span> indictione <span class="s08">XIV</span>, regnante Dn<span class="overline">o</span> nostro W.
Rege Magnif." The design of the priest Pantaleon,
wrought at the bidding of Archbishop Jonathan in
the last year of the first William, is of a most extensive
and varied kind. Scriptural scenes and persons,
figures which seem purely fanciful, the favourite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
subject of the signs of the zodiac, all find their place.
We meet also with one or two heroes of earlier and
later times whom we should hardly have looked for.
The main design starts, not far from the west end,
with a tree rising from the backs of two elephants.
The huge earth-shaking beast, the Lucanian ox, is, it
must be remembered, a favourite in southern Italy;
he finds a marked place among the sculptures of the
great churches of Bari. The tree&mdash;one is tempted to
see in it the mystic ash of Northern mythology&mdash;sends
its vast trunk along the central line of the nave, throwing
forth its branches, and what we may call their
fruit, on either side. Here are strange beasts which
may pass either for the fancies of the herald or for the
discoveries of the palæontologist; but in the lion with
four bodies and a single head we must surely look for
a symbolical meaning of some kind. He is balanced,
to be sure, by other strange forms, in which two or
three heads rise from a single body. Here are figures
with musical instruments, here a huntress aiming at
a stag; and in the midst of all this, not very far from
the west end, we find the figure of "Alexander Rex."
To the left we have Noah, making ready to build the
ark&mdash;the story begins at the beginning, like the
building of the Norman fleet in the Bayeux Tapestry.
Four figures are cutting down trees, and the patriarch
himself is sawing up the wood, with a saw of the type
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
still used in the country. The centre of the pavement
is occupied by the zodiac; each month has its befitting
work assigned to it according to the latitude of
Otranto. Thus June cuts the corn. July threshes it,
neither with a modern machine, nor with the feet of
primitive oxen, but with the flail which many of us will
remember in our youth. August, with his feet in the
wine-press, gathers the grapes. December carries a
boar, as if for the Yule feast of Queen Philippa's
scholars. Each month has its celestial sign attached;
but it would seem that the priest Pantaleon was in a
hurry in putting together his kalendar, and that he
put each of the signs a month in advance. Beyond
the zodiac, near the entrance of the choir, and partly
covered by its furniture, is a figure, which startles us
with the legend "Arturus Rex." If we were to have
Alexander and Arthur, why not the rest of the nine
worthies? If only a selection, why are the Hebrews
defrauded of their representative?&mdash;unless indeed
Samson, who appears in the form of a mutilated figure,
not far from the left of Arthur, has taken the place of
the more familiar Joshua, David, and Judas. Here is
a witness to the early spread of the Arthurian legends;
here, in 1165, within the Sicilian kingdom, the legendary
British hero receives a place of honour, alongside
of the Macedonian. Nor is this our only witness to
the currency in these regions of the tales which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
been not so long before spread abroad by Walter Map.
By this time, or not long after, the name of Arthur
had already found a local habitation on Ætna itself.
Among other scriptural pieces in different parts, we
find of course Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel;
there is Jonah too, far to the east; and in the eastern
part of the north aisle, the imagination of Jonathan
or Pantaleon has forestalled somewhat of the Dantesque
conception of the <i>Inferno</i>. "Satanas" is
vividly drawn, riding on a serpent, and other figures
armed with serpents are doing their terrible work in
the train of the "duke of that dark place." The
whole work is strictly mosaic, and the design, though
everywhere rude, is carried out with wonderful spirit.
We may indeed rejoice that the hoofs of Turkish
horses and the improvements of modern canons have
left so much of a work which, even if it stood by
itself, it would be worth while going to the end of
railways at Otranto to see.</p>

<p class="p2">Such is now the one city in which the Turk ever
ruled on our side of Hadria. In earlier times we might
have passed straight from Otranto to the lands where
he still rules, or to the island where he never ruled.
But now he who looks out for Otranto on the heights
of Albania, and whose objects call him to the nearer
neighbourhood of those heights, must go back to
Brindisi to find his way to reach them.</p>

<h3>FIRST GLIMPSES OF HELLAS.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>
<h4>1875&mdash;1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>In our present journey we draw near to the eastern
peninsula, to the Hellenic parts of that peninsula, by
way of the great island&mdash;great as compared with the
mass of Greek islands, though small as compared with
Sicily or Britain&mdash;which keeps guard, as a strictly
Hellenic outpost, over a mainland which was and is
less purely Hellenic. From Brindisi we sail to Corfu,
the elder Korkyra, as distinguished from the black
isle of the same name off the Dalmatian shore. In so
sailing, we specially feel ourselves to be sailing in the
wake of the conquerors who made Corfu an appendage
to the Sicilian realm; we are passing between spots
on either side which have known both a Norman and
Venetian master. But it may be that we may have
already drawn near to Greece by another path. It
is easy to prolong the voyage which took us from
Trieste to Spalato, from Spalato to Cattaro, by a third
stage which will take us from Cattaro to Corfu. In
this case we may have already studied the Albanian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
coast, and that with no small pleasure and profit.
We may have marked a point not long after we
had left Dalmatia behind us, and that where a
line may well be drawn. There is a geographical
change in the direction of the coast, from the shore of
Dalmatia, with its islands and inland seas, its coast-line
stretching away to the south-east, to the nearly
direct southern line of the shore of Albania. In
modern political geography we pass from the dominion
of Austria to the dominion of the Turk. In
the map of an earlier day, we pass from the all but
wholly continuous dominion of the two commonwealths
of Venice and Ragusa. In modern ethnology
we pass from the Slave under a certain amount of
Italian influence to the Albanian under a certain,
though smaller, amount of influence, Italian or Greek,
according to his local position and his religious creed.
In modern religious geography we pass from a land
which is wholly Christian, but where the Eastern form
of Christianity, though still in the minority, makes
itself more deeply felt at every step, to a land where
Islam and the two great ancient forms of Christianity
are all found side by side. In the geography of earlier
times this point marks the frontier of a land intermediate
between the barbaric land to the north, with
only a few Greek colonies scattered here and there,
and the purely Greek lands, the "continuous Hellas," to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
the south. We find on this western shore of the south-eastern
peninsula the same feature which is characteristic
of so large a part of the Ægæan and Euxine
coasts, both of the south-eastern peninsula itself and of
the neighbouring land of Asia. The great mainland
is barbarian; the islands and a fringe of sea-coast are
Greek. As we draw nearer to the boundary of Greece
proper, the Hellenic element is strengthened. Thesprotians,
Molossians, Chaonians, were at least capable
of becoming Greeks. Epeiros, <span class="greek" title="Êpeiros">&#7980;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>terra firma</i>,
once the vague name of an undefined barbarian region,
became the name of a Greek federal commonwealth
with definite boundaries. And the character of a barbarian
land, fringed with European settlements and
looking out on European islands, did not wholly pass
away till almost our own day. A few still living men
may remember the storming of Prevesa; many can remember
the cession&mdash;some might call it the betrayal&mdash;of
Parga. It was only when Parga was yielded to
the Turk that this ancient feature of the Illyrian and
Epeirot lands passed away. What Corinth had once
been Venice was. Corinth first studded that coast
with outposts of the civilized world. Venice held those
outposts, sadly lessened in number, down to her fall.
And the men of Parga deemed, though they were mistaken
in the thought, that to the mission of Corinth
and Venice England had succeeded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>From whichever side our traveller draws near to
Corfu, he comes from lands where Greek influence
and Greek colonization spread in ancient times, but
from which the Greek elements have been gradually
driven out, partly by the barbarism of the East, partly
by the rival civilization of the West. Whether we
come from Otranto and Brindisi or from the Illyrian
Pharos and the Illyrian Korkyra, we are coming from
lands which once were Greek. But Otranto and
Brindisi, Pharos and Black Korkyra, even Epidamnos
and Apollonia, were scattered outposts of Greek life
among barbarian neighbours; as the traveller draws
near to the elder Korkyra, he finds himself for the
first time within the bounds of "continuous Hellas."
He may have seen in other lands greater and more
speaking monuments of old Hellenic life than any
that the island has to show him; he may have seen
the lonely hill of Kymê, the hardly less lonely
temples of Poseidônia; but those were Greece in
Italy; now for the first time he sees Greece itself.
Whatever we may say of the mainland to the left,
there can be no doubt, either now or in ancient times,
of the Hellenic character of the island to the right.
There are the small attendant isles; there are the
great peaks of Korkyra&mdash;not the lowlier peaks which
gave city and island their later name&mdash;but the far
mightier mountains which catch the eye as we approach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
the great island from the north. That island
at least is Hellas&mdash;less purely Hellenic, it may be,
than some other lands and islands, but still Hellenic,
part of the immediate Hellenic world of both ancient
and modern days. It was and is the most distant part
of the immediate Hellenic world; but it forms an
integral part of it. The land which we see is Hellenic
in a sense in which not even Sicily, not even the
Great Hellas of Southern Italy, much less then the
Dalmatian archipelago, ever became Hellenic. From
the first historic glimpse which we get of Korkyra, it
is not merely a land fringed by Hellenic colonies; it
is a Hellenic island, the dominion of a single Hellenic
city, a territory the whole of whose inhabitants were,
at the beginning of recorded history, either actually
Hellenic or so thoroughly hellenized that no one
thought of calling their Hellenic position in question.
Modern policy has restored it to its old position by
making it an integral portion of the modern Greek
kingdom. And, if in some things it is less purely
Greek than the rest of that kingdom, what is the cause?
It is because, if Corfu may be thought for a while to
have ceased to be part of Greece, it never ceased to be
part of Christendom. It was for ages under alien
dominion, but it never was under the dominion of the
Turk. The Venetian could to some extent modify and
assimilate his Greek subjects; the Turk could modify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
or assimilate none but actual renegades. And, after
all, the main influence has been the other way. If
Italian became the fashionable speech, even for men
of Greek descent, men on the other hand whose names
distinctly show their Italian descent have cast in their
lot with their own country rather than with the country
of their forefathers. Shallow critics have mocked because
men with Venetian names have been strong
political assertors of Greek nationality. They might
as well mock whenever a man of Norman descent
shows himself a patriotic Englishman. They might
as well hint that Presidents and Ministers of France
and Spain, who have borne names which proclaim
their Irish origin, were bound or likely to follow an
Irish policy rather than a French or a Spanish one.</p>

<p>The first aspect, indeed every aspect, of the island
of Corfu and the neighbouring coast of Epeiros is
deeply instructive. The island and the mainland come
so close together that, till the eye has got well used
to the outline of particular mountains, it is not easy
to tell how much is island and how much mainland.
A statesman of the last generation twice told the
House of Lords that Corfu lay within a mile of the
coast of Thessaly. We cannot say, without looking
carefully to the scale on the map, how many miles
Corfu lies from the coast of Thessaly, any more than
we can say offhand how many miles Anglesey lies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
from the coast of Norfolk. It is a more practical fact
that some parts of Corfu lie very near indeed to the
coast of Epeiros, though not quite so near as Anglesey
lies to the coast of Caernarvonshire. The channel must
surely be everywhere more than a mile in width;
certainly it could nowhere be bridged, as in the case
of Anglesey, or in the cases of Euboia and nearer
Leukas. Both coasts are irregular, both coasts are
mountainous, and the mountains on both sides fuse
into one general mass. Above all, prominent from
many points, soars the famous range where, with a
singular disregard of later geography,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i2">"Arethusa arose</p>
<p class="i2">From her couch of snows</p>
<p>In the Acroceraunian mountains."</p>
</div>

<p>Snow of course is in these lands to be had only at
a much higher level than the snow-line of the Alps, so
that the couch of Arethousa stands out yet more conspicuously
over the neighbouring heights than it might
have done in a more northern region. The inhabitants
of Corfu are fond of pointing to the contrast between
the well-wooded hills and valleys of their own fertile
island and the bare, almost uninhabited, land which
lies opposite to them. And of course they do not fail
to point the inevitable moral. As in most such cases,
there is truth in the boast, but truth that needs some
qualifications. Corfu, through all its changes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
masters, has always been under governments which
were civilized according to the standard of their own
times. It has fared accordingly. Epeiros has been
handed over to a barbarian master, and it has also been
largely colonized by the least advanced of European
races. Besides having the Turk as a ruler, it has had
the Albanian, Christian and Mussulman, as a settler. In
Corfu the Albanian is a frequent visitor; his sheepskin
and <i>fustanella</i> may be constantly seen in the streets of
Corfu; but he has not&mdash;unless possibly in the shape of
refugees from Parga&mdash;formed any distinct element in
her population. It is only in the nature of things that
Greeks under successive Venetian, French, and English
rule should do more for their land than Albanians under
Turkish rule. But we may doubt whether any people
under any government could have made the land
opposite to Corfu like Corfu itself. Had the mainland
shared the successive destinies of the island, it would
doubtless have been far better off than it has been.
But it could hardly have been as the island. One
point of advantage for the island was the mere fact
that it was an island. In all but the highest states of
civilization, this is an advantage beyond words; and
the ancient colonists fully understood the fact.</p>

<p>Still it is a striking contrast to pass across the
narrow sea from Corfu to what was Butrinto. Buthrotum,
the mythical city of the Trojan Helenos, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
a more real being as a Roman colony, and as one of
those outposts on the mainland in which Venice succeeded
the Neapolitan Kings, and which she kept
down to her own fall. Butrinto was once a city no
less than Corfu; to Virgil's eyes it was the reproduction
of Troy itself. Now we cross from the busy
streets and harbour of Corfu to utter desolation at
Butrinto. The desolation is greater in one way than
any that Helenos or any other primitive settler could
have found, because it is that form of desolation which
consists in traces of what has been. We enter the
mouth of the river, with rich trees and pasturage
between its banks and the rugged mountains; we
mark ruins of fortresses and buildings on either side,
till we come to the ruined castle at the mouth of the
lake. The lake is a carefully preserved fishery, and
permission is needed to enter it. A few dirty-looking
men assemble at the door of a tumble-down building
standing against the ruined castle. But among them
are personages of some local importance. One is the
lessee of the fishery, whose good will is of special
importance. There is also a Turkish officer of some
kind&mdash;more likely a Mussulman Albanian than an
Ottoman&mdash;with his small and not threatening following.
There are one or two native Christians; and it
brings the varied ethnology of the land more deeply
home to learn that they are neither Greeks nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Albanians, but that they belong to the scattered race
of the Vlachs, the Latin-speaking people of the East,
whose greatest settlement, far away from Butrinto,
has now grown into an European kingdom. It is
well to be reminded at such a moment that the
Rouman principality, though the greatest, is only one
among many, and that the latest, of the settlements of
this scattered people. And it brings home the fact to
us when we see here, in a land where Greek and
Albanian&mdash;that is, Hellên and Illyrian&mdash;are both at
home, the third of the great primitive races of the
peninsula, the widely spread Thracian kin, the people
of Sitalkês and Kersobleptês, so far away from the
land in which alone political geography acknowledges
them.</p>

<p>One feeling however the group, so small, but differing
so widely in race and creed, seem all to share very
deeply. This is a devout reverence for the image of
George King of the Greeks, when graven on a five- (new)
drachma piece, and held up in the hand of one
of the representatives of Corfu in the Greek Parliament.
We remember the ancient power of much
smaller coins&mdash;<span class="greek" title="hôs mega dynasthon pantachou tô dy' obolô">&#8033;&#962; &#956;&#941;&#947;&#945; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#8060; &#948;&#973;' &#8000;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#974;</span>&mdash;and
we begin to doubt whether a smaller sum might
not have done the work as well. Anyhow his Hellenic
Majesty's countenance, in this attractive shape, acts as
a talisman on all, private and official, Christian and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Mussulman; it buys off all questions or searchings
of any kind, and wins free access to the beautiful
scenery of the lake, full licence to poke about among
what little there is to poke about in the shattered castle.
The thought cannot help coming into the mind that
those who so greatly respect the image and superscription
of King George would have no very violent
dislike to become his subjects. Still it is not without
a certain feeling of having escaped out of the mouth
of the lion that we cross once more over the channel,
and find ourselves at the hospitable door of a Greek
gentleman of Koloura.</p>

<h3>CORFU AND ITS NAMES.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>
<h4>1875.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The great argument to establish the fact of a long-abiding
Slavonic occupation in Greece has always
been the changes in local nomenclature, the actual
Slavonic names and the Greek names which have
displaced older Greek names. The former class speak
for themselves; the latter class are held to have been
given during the process of Greek reconquest. Nor
can there be any reasonable doubt that there is a large
amount of truth in this doctrine, if only it is kept in
moderation, and is not pressed to the extreme conclusions
of Fallmerayer. But it is important to note
that the change from one Greek name to another has
taken place also in cases when there has been no foreign
settlement, no reconquest, no violent change of any
kind. One of the greatest of Greek islands has lost
one Greek name and has taken another, without the
operation of any of the causes which are said to have
brought about the change of nomenclature in Peloponnêsos.
Crete and Euboia, we may say in passing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
seem to have changed their names, when in truth they
have not; but Korkyra really has changed its name.
It had, for all purposes, become Corfu&mdash;in some
spelling or other&mdash;till the modern revival&mdash;unwisely,
we must venture to think&mdash;brought back, not the true
local <i>Korkyra</i> (<span class="greek" title="Korkyra">&#922;&#972;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>), but the Attic and Byzantine
<i>Kerkyra</i> (<span class="greek" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>). City and island alike are now
again <span class="greek" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>; or rather we cannot say that the city
is again <span class="greek" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>, as the modern city never was <span class="greek" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>
at all, nor even <span class="greek" title="Korkyra">&#922;&#972;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>. The modern town of Corfu&mdash;in
its best Greek form <span class="greek" title="Koryphô">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#974;</span>&mdash;stands on a different
site from the ancient town of Korkyra, and there
can be little doubt that the change of name is connected
with the change of site.</p>

<p>The legendary history of the island goes up, we
need not say, to the Homeric tales. That Korkyra
was the Homeric Scheriê was an accepted article of
faith as early as the days of Thucydides. His casual
phrase goes for more than any direct statement. He
connects the naval greatness of the Korkyraians of his
day with the seafaring fame of the mythical Phaiakians
(<span class="greek" title="nautikô poly proechein estin hote epairomenoi

&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#934;&#945;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#922;&#949;&#961;&#954;&#973;&#961;&#945;&#962;
&#954;&#955;&#941;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#967;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8048; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#957;&#945;&#8166;&#962;</span>). Nearly a thousand
years later Prokopios is equally believing, though he
goes into some doubts and speculations as to the
position of the isle of Kalypsô. His way of describing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
the island should be noticed. With him the
island is the Phaiakian land, which is now called
<i>Korkyra</i> (<span class="greek" title="hê Phaiakôn chôra, hê nyn Kerkyra epikaleitai">&#7969; &#934;&#945;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#957; &#967;&#974;&#961;&#945;, &#7971; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>).
Against this description we may fairly balance that
of Nikêtas (<span class="greek" title="hê Kerkyraiôn akra, hê nyn epikeklêtai
Koryphô">&#7969; &#922;&#949;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#7940;&#954;&#961;&#945;, &#7971; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#954;&#941;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;
&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#974;</span>), with whom the promontory of the Kerkyraians
is now called <i>Koryphô</i>. The two answer to
each other. To talk of <span class="greek" title="Kerkyraiôn akra">&#922;&#949;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#7940;&#954;&#961;&#945;</span> was as
much an archaism in the eleventh century as to talk
of <span class="greek" title="Phaiakôn chôra">&#934;&#945;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#957; &#967;&#974;&#961;&#945;</span> was in the sixth. The everyday
name of the island in the days of Prokopios was still
<span class="greek" title="Korkyra">&#922;&#972;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span> or <span class="greek" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>. In the days of Nikêtas it was
already <span class="greek" title="Koryphô">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#974;</span>.</p>

<p>We put the two phrases of Prokopios and Nikêtas
together, because they are turned out as it were from
the same mould. But there is no doubt that the
change of name had happened a good while before
Nikêtas, and there is some reason to believe that it
was the result of causes which are set forth in the
narrative of Prokopios. The earliest mention of
Corfu by its present name seems to be that in Liudprand,
who calls it "Coriphus" in the plural, the Greek
<span class="greek" title="Koryphous">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span>. The change therefore happened between the
sixth century and the tenth, the change doubtless of site
no less than the change of name. And no time seems
more likely for either than the time which followed
the wasting expedition of Totilas which Prokopios
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
records. Then doubtless it was that the old city, if it
did not at once perish, at least began to decay; a new
site began to be occupied; a new town arose, and that
new town took a new name from its most remarkable
physical feature, the <span class="greek" title="koryphô">&#954;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#974;</span>, the two peaks crowned
by the citadel, which form the most striking feature in
the entrance to the harbour of modern Corfu.</p>

<p>One argument alone need be mentioned the other
way, and that is one which perhaps is not likely to
present itself to any one out of Corfu itself. The local
writer Quirini quotes a single line as from Dionysios
Periêgêtês, which runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="greek" title="keinên nyn Korphyn nautai diephêmixanto.">&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#922;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8058;&#957; &#957;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#953;&#949;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#943;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;.</span></p>

<p>Dionysios is a writer of uncertain date; but he may
safely be set down as older than Prokopios. If then
he used the later name, and used it in a form more
modern than the <span class="greek" title="Koryphô">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#974;</span> of Nikêtas, the whole argument
would be set aside, and the name of Corfu would
be carried back to a much earlier time. But where
Quirini got his verse is by no means clear. We have
looked in more than one edition of Dionysios, and no
such verse can we find. The only mention of Korkyra
is in a verse which runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="greek" title="kai liparê Kerkyra, philon pedon Alkinooio.">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#955;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8052; &#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;, &#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#941;&#948;&#959;&#957; &#7944;&#955;&#954;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#959;&#953;&#959;.
</span></p>

<p>Nor does the commentator Eustathios say one word as
to the change of name. We can only conceive that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
the line must have been added as a gloss in some
copy, printed or manuscript, which was consulted by
Quirini.</p>

<p>We will assume then that, as far as the island is
concerned, Korkyra and Corfu&mdash;in its various spellings&mdash;are
two successive names, one of which supplanted
the other, while, as far as the city is concerned,
they are strictly the names of two distinct though
neighbouring cities, one of which fell as the other
rose. And now the question comes, Is the island of
Korkyra the Scheriê of Homer? Is his description
of Scheriê and the city of Alkinoos meant for the
description of Korkyra or any part of it, whether the
historical city or any other? We must remember that
the general witness of antiquity in favour of Korkyra
being Scheriê loses a good deal of its weight when we
consider that the ancient writers felt bound to place
Scheriê somewhere, while no such necessity is laid
upon us. Bearing this in mind, the plain case seems
to be that it is far more likely that Scheriê was
nowhere at all. In dealing with Scheriê and its inhabitants,
we are not dealing with an entry in the
Catalogue of the Iliad, the Domesday of the Mykênaian
empire; we are simply dealing with a piece
of the romantic geography of the Odyssey. Everything
about the Phaiakians and their land reads as if
the whole thing was as purely a play of the imagination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
as the Kyklôpes and the Laistrygones. It is
indeed quite possible that, even in describing purely
imaginary lands, a poet may bring in his remembrance
of real places, just as the features of a real
person may be reproduced in the picture of an imaginary
event. The poet, in painting Scheriê, may
have brought in bits of local description from Korkyra
or from any other place. But that is all. As we read
the story, it seems quite as reasonable to look on the
map for Nephelokokkygia as to look on the map for
Scheriê. The thinkers of the days of Thucydides or of
some time before Thucydides, deeming themselves
bound to place Scheriê somewhere, fixed it at Korkyra.
The reason doubtless was that the Phaiakians are
spoken of as the most distant of mankind, far away
from any others, and that Korkyra really was for a
long time the most distant of Greek settlements in this
region. When Korkyra was once ruled to be Scheriê,
the process of identification naturally went on. Spots
received Homeric names. Alkinoos had his grove and
his harbour in the historical Korkyra. All this is the
common course of legend, and proves nothing for
either geography or history. Yet the tale of Scheriê,
of Alkinoos, Arêtê, and the charming Nausikaa, is not
simply one of the loveliest of tales. Scheriê knew the
use of wheeled carriages; therefore Scheriê had roads.
Alkinoos, the head king, was chief over twelve lesser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
kings. Here we get real history, though history
neither personal nor local. Scheriê itself may safely
be looked for in the moon; but the roads of Scheriê
and the <i>Bretwalda</i> of Scheriê have their place in the
early history of institutions.</p>

<p>Other names of the island are spoken of, as Drepanê
and Makris, descriptive names which perhaps never
were in real use, and which, if they were, were supplanted
by the historical name of Korkyra. We must
again repeat that <i>Korkyra</i>, not <i>Kerkyra</i>, is the genuine
local name. It is the spelling on the coins of the
country; it is the spelling of the Latin writers, who
would get the name from the island itself; it is the
spelling of Strabo. But it is equally plain that in
Greece generally the spelling <span class="greek" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span> prevailed. It
is so in Herodotus and the Attic writers; it is so in
Polybios; it is so in the Byzantine writers, who of
course affect Attic forms. It must never be forgotten
that, from the time of Polybios, perhaps from an
earlier time than his, down to the present moment,
written Greek has been one thing, and spoken Greek
another. Polybios wrote <span class="greek" title="Kerkyra">&#922;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>, while its own people
called it <span class="greek" title="Korkyra">&#922;&#972;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>, just as he wrote <span class="greek" title="Êlis">&#7982;&#955;&#953;&#962;</span>, while its
own people called it <span class="greek" title="Walis">&#988;&#8118;&#955;&#953;&#962;</span>. The difference has been
thought to have its origin in some joke or sarcasm&mdash;some
play on <span class="greek" title="kerkos, kerkouros">&#954;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#962;, &#954;&#941;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, and the like. But the
literary form may just as likely be simply a tempting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
softening of the local form. One point only is to be
insisted on, that the syllable <span class="greek" title="Kor">&#922;&#959;&#961;</span> in <span class="greek" title="Korkyra">&#922;&#972;&#961;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>, and the
syllable <span class="greek" title="Kor">&#922;&#959;&#961;</span> in <span class="greek" title="Koryphô">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#974;</span>, have nothing to do with one
another. The latter name is no corruption of the
elder; it is a genuine case of one Greek name supplanting
another&mdash;perhaps rather a case of a Greek
name, after so many ages, supplanting a name which
the first Greek colonists may have borrowed from
earlier barbarian inhabitants. In this case the change
implies no change of inhabitants, no change of
language. It is a change within the Greek language
itself, which can be fully accounted for by historical
causes. It therefore teaches that changes of name,
such as the Slavonic theory insists on in Peloponnêsos,
though they do often arise from new settlements and
reconquests, do also come about in other ways.</p>

<p>It is for the mythologist to find out whether Homer
had Korkyra in his eye when he described the mythic
Scheriê. This, be it again noted, is a perfectly
reasonable subject for inquiry, and in no way implies
any historical belief in the legend. It is simply like
asking whether the real Glastonbury at all suggested
the mythic Avalon. History begins to deal with
Korkyra in the eighth century <span class="s05">B.C.</span>, when the settlement
of the Corinthian Chersikratês added the island
to the Greek world. From that day onward the island
has a long and eventful story, reaching down to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
own times. But, before that story begins, the historian
may fairly ask of the ethnologist what evidence, what
hints of any kind, there are as to the people whom the
Corinthian colonists found settled in the island. It is
not likely that they found so promising a site wholly
uninhabited. Some branch of the great Illyrian race,
the race which is still so near to the island, and which
still supplies it, if not with inhabitants, at least with
constant visitors, may well be supposed to have made
their way into so tempting an island. The harbours
of Corfu would surely attract the seafaring Liburnians.
We are then brought to the common conditions of a
Greek colony, planted, as usual, among pre-existing
barbarian inhabitants, and, as Mr. Grote has so
strongly enforced, sure to receive a dash of barbarian
blood among some classes of its members. The <i>dêmos</i>
of Korkyra may well have been far from being of pure
Hellenic descent&mdash;a fact which, if it be so, may go
far to explain the wide difference between the <i>dêmos</i> of
Korkyra and the <i>dêmos</i> of Athens. Since the time of
the Corinthian settlement, the island has undergone
endless conquests and changes of masters, each of
which has doubtless brought with it a fresh infusion
into the blood of its inhabitants. But since the time
of Chersikratês there has been nothing like extirpation,
displacement, or resettlement. Korkyra has ever
since been an Hellenic land, though a succession of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
foreign occupations may have marred the purity of
its Hellenism. And one point at once distinguishes
it from all the neighbouring lands. Among all the
changes of masters which Korkyra or Corfu has undergone,
they have always been European masters. It
is the one land in those parts that has never seen
the Turk as more than a momentary invader, to be
speedily beaten back by European prowess.</p>

<p>So much for the origin and the name of the greatest
of the group which in modern geography has come by
the strange name of the Ionian Islands. The only
sense in which that name has any meaning is if it be
taken as meaning the Islands of the Ionian Sea. It
ought to be needless to remind any one that the word
in that sense has nothing whatever to do with the real
Ionians, with the Ionic dialect or the Ionic order. It
certainly has an odd effect when one hears the people
of Doric Korkyra spoken of as "Ionians;" and we
have even seen the whole group of islands spoken of as
"Ionia," to the great wrong of Chios, Samos, Ephesos,
and others of the famous Ionian twelve. But having
said so much about names, we must in another paper
say something of the long series of revolutions which
mark the history of Korkyra under its two names, and
of their effect on its present state.</p>

<h3>CORFU AND ITS HISTORY.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span></p>
<h4>1875.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We have already spoken of the singular change of
name which has befallen the most famous and important,
though not the largest in superficial extent,
of the group known as the Ionian Islands. The
change of name, as we hold, followed naturally on the
change of site of the city. The new city took a new
name, and the island has always followed the name
of the city. The old city and the new both occupy
neighbouring points in a system of small peninsulas
and havens, which form the middle of the eastern
coast of the long and irregularly-shaped island of
Korkyra. There, to the south of the present town,
connected with it by a favourite walk of the inhabitants
of Corfu, a long and broad peninsula stretches
boldly into the sea. Both from land and from sea, it
chiefly strikes the eye as a wooded mass, thickly
covered with the aged olive-trees which form so
marked a feature in the scenery of the island. A few
houses skirt the base, growing on the land side into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
the suburb of Kastrades, which may pass for a kind
of connecting link between the old and the new city.
And from the midst of the wood, on the side nearest to
the modern town, stands out the villa of the King of
the Greeks, the chief modern dwelling on the site of
ancient Korkyra. This peninsular hill, still known
as Palaiopolis, was the site of the old Corinthian city
whose name is so familiar to every reader of Thucydides.
On either side of it lies one of its two forsaken
harbours. Between the old and the new city lies the
so-called harbour of Alkinoos; beyond the peninsula,
stretching far inland, lies the old Hyllaic harbour,
bearing the name of one of the three tribes which
seem to have been essential to the being of a Dorian
commonwealth. But the physical features of the
country have greatly changed since Chersikratês led
thither his band of settlers twenty-six centuries back.
It is plain that both harbours once came much further
inland than they do now, that they covered a great
deal of the low ground at the foot of the peninsular
hill. The question indeed presents itself, whether
the two did not once meet, whether the peninsula was
not once an island, whether the original colony did
not occupy a site standing to the mainland of Korkyra
in exactly the same relation in which the original
insular Syracuse, the sister Corinthian colony, stood
to the mainland of Sicily. The physical aspect of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
country certainly strongly suggests the belief. And
though Thucydides does not directly speak of the
city as insular, though his words do not at all suggest
that it was so, yet we do not know that there is
anything in his narrative which directly shuts out the
idea. Anyhow, the great change which has happened
is plain when we see how utterly the great Hyllaic
haven has lost the character of a haven. It is now
called a lake, and exists only for purposes of fishing.
We may believe that these physical changes had a
great deal to do with the removal of the city to
another site, with the change from Korkyra to Corfu.</p>

<p>The description which Thucydides gives of the
great sedition brings out a fact which we should at
first sight hardly have expected, the fact that the
aristocratic quarter of Korkyra was on the lower
ground by the harbour, while the upper part of the
town was occupied by the <i>dêmos</i>. To one who thinks
of Rome, Athens, and ancient cities generally, this seems
strange. But arguments from the most ancient class
of cities do not fully apply to cities of the colonial class.
These, where commerce was so great an object, were
no longer, as a rule, placed on heights; convenient
access from the sea was a main point, and we can
therefore understand that the ground by the coast
would be first settled, and would remain the dwelling-place
of the old citizens, the forefathers of the oligarchs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
of the great sedition. There on the lower ground was
the <i>agora</i>, where the Epidamnian exiles craved for
help, and pointed to the tombs of their forefathers.
The impression of the scene becomes more lively when
we see not far off an actual ancient tomb remaining in
its place, though it could hardly have been the tomb
of the forefather of any Epidamnian. This is the
tomb of Menekratês of Oianthê, honoured in this way
by the people of Korkyra on account of his friendship
for their city, a plain round tomb with one of those
archaic inscriptions in which Korkyra is rich. Archaic
indeed it is, written from right to left, in characters
which mere familiarity with the Greek of printed books
or of later inscriptions will not enable any one to read
off with much ease. It formed doubtless only one of
a range of tombs, doubtless outside the city, but
visible from the <i>agora</i>. An orator in the Roman forum
could not have pointed to the tombs of forefathers by
the Appian Way.</p>

<p>The position of the quarter of the oligarchs by the
modern suburb of Kastrades seems perfectly clear from
Thucydides. The <i>dêmos</i> took refuge in the upper part
of the city and held the Hyllaic harbour; the other
party held the <i>agora</i>, where most of them dwelled,
and the harbour near it and towards the continent
(<span class="greek" title="hoi de tên te agoran katelabon, houper hoi polloi ôkoun

&#7972;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
This district marks out the haven by
Kastrades, looking out on the Albanian mountains,
as distinguished from the Hyllaic haven shut in by
the hills of Korkyra itself.</p>

<p>But where was the Hêraion, the temple of Hêrê,
which plays a part in more than one of the Thucydidean
narratives? and where was the island opposite
to the Hêraion&mdash;<span class="greek" title="pros to Hêraion">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#7977;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>&mdash;and the isle of
Ptychia, both of which appear in his history? The
answer to the former question seems to turn on
another. Was the present citadel, the true <span class="greek" title="Koryphô">&#922;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#974;</span>,
itself always an island, as it is now? The present
channel is artificial&mdash;that is to say, it is made artificial
by fortifications&mdash;but it may after all have been a
natural channel improved by art. And that is the
belief of some of the best Corfiote antiquaries. If so,
this may well be the <span class="greek" title="nêsos pros to Hêraion">&#957;&#8134;&#963;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#7977;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>, and
Ptychia may be the isle of Vido beyond. The Hêraion
would thus stand on the north side of the old Korkyra,
looking towards the modern city; it would stand in
the oligarchic quarter on the low ground near the
<i>agora</i>. It was therefore neither of the two temples of
which traces remain. One, of which the walls can be
traced out nearly throughout, and of which a single
broken Doric column is standing, overlooks the open
sea towards Epeiros. Another on the other side overlooked
the Hyllaic harbour. This in course of time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
became a church, a now ruined church, but which
keeps large parts of its Hellenic walls and some windows
of beautiful Byzantine brickwork. It seems
hardly possible in any case that the Hêraion could
have been at quite the further end of the peninsula,
and that the island <span class="greek" title="pros to Hêraion">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#7977;&#961;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#957;
</span> could be either of
the small islands, each containing a church, which
keep the entrance of the Hyllaic harbour.</p>

<p>Such then was old Korkyra, the colony of Chersikratês,
the Korkyra which figures in the tale of
Periandros, the Korkyra which played such a doubtful
part in the Persian War, which gained so fearful a
name in the Peloponnesian War, and which, within
two generations, had so thoroughly recovered itself
that in the days of Timotheos it struck both friends
and enemies by its wealth and flourishing state. It is
the Korkyra of Pyrrhos and Agathoklês, the Korkyra
which formed one of the first stepping-stones for the
Roman to make his way to the Hellenic continent,
the Korkyra whose history goes on till the wasting
inroad of Totilas. Then, as we hold, ancient Korkyra
on its peninsula began to give way to Koryphô (Corfu)
on another peninsula or island, that to which the two
peaks which form its most marked feature gave its name.</p>

<img src="images/i407.jpg" width="439" height="600" alt="Churches at Corfu" />
<p class="caption">CHURCHES AT CORFU.</p>
</div>

<p>This last is the Corfu whose fate seems to have
been to become the possession of every power which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
has ruled in that quarter of the world, with one exception.
For fourteen hundred years the history of
the island is the history of endless changes of masters.
We see it first a nominal ally, then a direct possession,
of Rome and of Constantinople; we then see it formed
into a separate Byzantine principality, conquered by
the Norman lord of Sicily, again a possession of the
Empire, then a momentary possession of Venice, again
a possession of the Sicilian kingdom under its Angevin
kings, till at last it came back to Venetian rule,
and abode for four hundred years under the Lion of
Saint Mark. Then it became part of that first strange
Septinsular Republic of which the Tzar was to be the
protector and the Sultan the overlord. Then it was
a possession of France; then a member of the second
Septinsular Republic under the hardly disguised
sovereignty of England; now at last it is the most
distant, but one of the most valuable, of the provinces
of the modern Greek kingdom. But Corfu has never
for a moment been under the direct rule of the
Turk. The proudest memory in the later history of
the island is the defeat of the Turks in 1716. Peloponnêsos,
the conquest of Morosini, had again been
lost, and the Turk deemed that he might again carry
his conquests into the Western seas. The city was
besieged by land and sea; the two fleets, Christian
and infidel, stretched across the narrow channel between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
the island and the mainland, the left wing of
the Turkish fleet resting strangely enough on Venetian
Butrinto, while the ships of Venice and her allies
stretched from Vido to the Albanian shore. The
statue of Schulemberg, set up as an unparalleled
honour in his lifetime, adorns the esplanade of the
city which he saved. Unless we count the Turkish
acquisition of the Venetian points on the mainland,
which, though done under the cover of a treaty, took
at Prevesa at least the form of an actual conquest,
this was the last great attempt of the Turk to extend
his dominion by altogether fresh conquests at the
expense of any Christian power.</p>

<p>Korkyra thus gave way to Corfu, and the endless
fortifications of Corfu of every date were largely built
out of the remains of Korkyra which supplied so convenient
a quarry. None but an accomplished military
engineer could attempt to give an account of the
remains of all the fortifications, Venetian and English,
dismantled, ruined, or altogether blown up. But the
kingdom of which Corfu now forms a part still keeps
the insular citadel, the outline of the two peaks
being sadly disfigured by the needs of modern military
defence. Of the modern city there is but little
to say. As becomes a city which was so long a
Venetian possession, the older part of it has much of
the character of an Italian town. It is rich in street
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
arcades; but they present but few architectural features,
and we find none of those various forms of
ornamental window, so common, not only in Venice
and Verona, but in Spalato, Cattaro, and Traü. The
churches in the modern city are architecturally worthless.
They are interesting so far as they will give to
many their first impression of Orthodox arrangement
and Orthodox ritual. The few ecclesiastical antiquities
of the place belong to the elder city. The
suburb of the lower slope of the hill contains three
churches, all of them small, but each of which has an
interest of its own. Of one, known as <span class="greek" title="hê Panagia tôn
blachernôn">&#7969; &#928;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#946;&#955;&#945;&#967;&#949;&#961;&#957;&#8182;&#957;
</span>, we have already spoken; another, known
specially as Our Lady of <i>Oldbury</i> (<span class="greek" title="hê Panagia palaiopoleôs">&#7969; &#928;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#943;&#945; &#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>),
is unattractive enough from any point from
which the spectator is likely to see it. Its form is by
courtesy called basilican; but, if so, it is like the
basilica of Trier, without columns or arches. Within
it is a dreary building enough, but it presents one
object of interest in a side-altar, a Latin intrusion
into the Orthodox fabric. But the west end is one of
the most memorable things to be found in Corfu or
anywhere else. Two columns, not of the usual early
Doric of the island, but with floriated capitals, though
not exactly Corinthian, are built into the wall with a
piece of their entablature. On this is graven a
Christian inscription, which is given in an inaccurate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
shape by Mustoxidi (<i>Delle cose Corciresi</i>, p. 405), who
has further improved the spelling. The spelling is in
truth after the manner of Liudprand and the modern
shoe-makers of Corfu, and is therefore instructive. At
the top come the words of the Psalmist; "This is the
gate of the Lord; the <i>writeous</i> shall enter into it":&mdash;<span class="greek" title="hautê

<p>Who was this Jovianus? Clearly a Christian as
zealous as his Imperial namesake; for he cannot be
the Emperor himself, as some have thought. He
thought it glory and not shame to destroy the works
of the Gentiles&mdash;the <span class="greek" title="Hellênes">&#7965;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span>&mdash;and to turn them to
the service of the royal faith. But are we to take
the "royal faith" in the same sense as the "royal
law" of the New Testament? or does it mean the
"royal faith," as being set up under some orthodox
Emperor, when the orthodoxy of Emperors was still a
new thing? Anyhow the plunderer of Gentile temples
and altars could not keep himself from something
of the Gentile in the ring and the language
of his verses. And had he made use of his spoil to
rear a basilica like those of Constantine and Theodoric,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
we should, from a wider view than that of the
mere classical antiquary, have but little right to
blame him. The rest of the columns, besides the two
that are left, would have well relieved the bareness
of his interior; better still would it have been if Saint
Peter <i>ad Vincula</i> had found a rival in two arcades
formed out of the Doric columns whose fragments lie
about at Corfu, almost as Corinthian and Composite
fragments lie about at Rome. The third church, that
which professes to be the oldest in the island, that
which bears the name of the alleged apostles of the
island, the Jasôn and Sosipatros of the New Testament,
is a more successful work. Brought to its present
form about the twelfth century by the priest Stephen,
as is recorded in two inscriptions on its west front,
it is, allowing for some modern disfigurements, an
admirable specimen of a small Byzantine church. It
will remind him who comes by way of Dalmatia of old
friends at Zara, Spalato, and Traü; but it has the
advantage over them of somewhat greater size, and
of standing free and detached, so that the outline of
its cross, its single central cupola and its three apses,
may be well seen. This church, like most in the
neighbourhood, has a bell-gable&mdash;<span class="greek" title="kôdônostasion">&#954;&#969;&#948;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>&mdash;with
arches for three bells, of a type which seems to be
found of all ages from genuine Byzantine to late
<i>Renaissance</i>.

<p>To go back to earlier times, the museum of Corfu
contains an inscription, <span class="greek" title="boustrophêdon">&#946;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#948;&#972;&#957;</span> inscription, rivalling
that of Menekratês in its archaism, attached to a
Doric capital, of far later workmanship, one would have
thought, than the inscription. The building art had
clearly outstripped the writing art. The military
cemetery contains some beautiful Greek sepulchral
sculptures from various quarters, not all Korkyraian.
And at some distance from the city, near the shore
of Benizza&mdash;a name of Slavonic sound&mdash;is a Roman
ruin with mosaics and hypocaust, whose bricks we
think Mr. Parker would rule to be not older than
Diocletian. In Corfu such a monument seems at first
sight to be out of place. For Hellenic remains, for
Venetian remains, we naturally look; still it is well
to have something of an intermediate day, something
to remind us of the long ages which passed between
the revolutions recorded by Polybios and the revolutions
recorded by Nikêtas.</p>

<h3>CORFU TO DURAZZO.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>
<h4>1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We start again from Corfu, and this time our course
is northward. A survey of Greece as Greece would
lead us southward and eastward. So would even a
complete survey of the subject lands of Venice. For
that we must go on to the rest of the western islands,
to not a few points in the Ægæan, to the greater
islands of Euboia and Crete, to Saint Mark's own
realm of Cyprus, which the Evangelist so strangely
inherited from his daughter and her son. Not a few
points of Peloponnêsos for some ages, all Peloponnêsos
for a few years, Athens itself for a moment, comes
within the same range. We might write the history
of Argos from the Venetian point of view, a point of
view which would shut out the history of Mykênê,
and would look on Tiryns only as <i>Palai-Nauplia</i>, the
precursor of Napoli di Romania. But no man could
journey through Greece itself with Venice in this way
in his thoughts. Far older, far nobler, memories
would press upon him at every moment. The mediæval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
history of Greece is a subject which deserves far more
attention than it commonly gets, and in that history
Venice plays a prominent part. But it is hard, in a
Greek journey, to make the mediæval history primary,
and even in the mediæval history Venice is only one
element among others. A large part of Greece fairly
comes under the head of the Subject and Neighbour
Lands of Venice; but we cannot bring ourselves to
make that the chief aspect in which we look at them.
It is otherwise with the Dalmatian and Albanian
possessions of the Republic. There, though other
points of view are possible, yet the special Venetian
point of view is one which may be both easily and
fairly taken. So too with Corfu; thoroughly Greek
as the island is, it still lies on the very verge of
continuous Greece. In its history and geography it
is closely connected with the more northern possessions
of the Republic; its Venetian side is at least as
important as any other side; we can without an effort
bring ourselves to treat it in a way in which we could
hardly bring ourselves to treat Argos. We can then
fairly take Corfu into our special Venetian survey;
but we can hardly venture to carry that survey further.
The rest of Greece, though it has its Venetian side,
though it is important that its Venetian side should
not be forgotten, can never be looked on in this way as
an appendage to the Hadriatic commonwealth. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
cannot go through the earliest homes of European civilization
and freedom, and keep our mind mainly fixed
even on the days when Rome had made them members
of her Empire, and when their influence had gone
far to make the later power of Rome at least as much
Greek as Roman. Still less can we go through them
with our mind mainly fixed on the days when so large
part of Greece had passed under the rule of a city
which was in truth a revolted member of the Empire
which it helped to split in pieces.</p>

<p>We start then again from Corfu, with our faces turned
towards our old haunts among the Illyrian coasts and
islands. In so doing, we pass for a while out of the
Christian and civilized world, to skirt along the coasts
where Europe is still in bondage to Asia. The wrong
is an old one, as old as the days when Herodotus put
on record how Greek cities for the first time passed
under the rule of a barbarian master. From his day,
from times long before his day, from the days of Agamemnôn,
perhaps from the days of the brave men who
lived before him, the same long strife has been going
on, the same "eternal Eastern question" has been awaiting
its "solution." And nowhere does that abiding
struggle come more fully home to us than in the lands
where the Eastern question has become a Western
question. The Greek cities whose bondage to the
barbarian was recorded by Herodotus were Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
cities on barbarian ground. They were outposts of
Europe on the soil of Asia; they were spots in winning
which the Asiatic might deem that he was
winning back his own. And after all, the barbarian
whose conquest of the Greek cities of Asia marks
one important stage in this long strife, was a
barbarian of another kind from the barbarians whom
European lands have in later times been driven to
receive as masters. Cr&oelig;sus worshipped the Gods
of Greece, and Greek poets sang his praises. It may
even be that the Lydian, like the Persian who succeeded
him, was not a barbarian at all in the strictest
sense, but that there was some measure of kindred,
however distant, between him and his European subjects.
It is another kind of master, another kind of
bondage, which has fallen to the lot of the lands along
whose coast we are now sailing. Here we do indeed
see the West in bondage to the East, we do indeed see
Europe on her own soil bowed down beneath the yoke
of Asia. We pass by coasts which look to the setting
sun no less than our own island, but which the Asiatic
intruder still holds beneath the yoke,&mdash;over some
of which he has pressed the yoke for the first time
within the memory of living men. On these coasts
at least we think of Venice only in her nobler character.
Here indeed every island, every headland,
which owned her rule, was something saved from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
grasp of the enemy; it was indeed a brand plucked
from the burning. As we sail northward, we leave
spots behind us, memorable in past times, memorable
some of them in our own day. We leave behind us
Prevesa, where, till almost within our own century,
Saint Mark still held his own, hard by the City of
Victory of the first Emperor. We remember how
Prevesa was torn away from Christendom by the arms
of Ali of Jôannina, and how within the last three years
freedom has been twice promised to her but never
given. We leave behind us more famous Parga, where,
within the lifetime of many of us, stout hearts could still
maintain their freedom, in the teeth alike of barbarian
force and of European diplomacy&mdash;Parga, whose banished
sons bore with them the bones of their fathers
rather than leave them to be trampled on by the feet of
the misbelievers. There must be men still living who
had their share in that famous exodus, and who have
lived to see Europe first decree that their land should be
again set free, and then thrust it back again beneath
the yoke. We leave behind us Butrinto, happier at
least in this, that there no promise of later days has
been broken. There we have passed the point beyond
which assembled Europe ruled that even the dreams
of freedom might go no further. And as we sail
between the home of freedom and the house of bondage,
our thoughts overleap the mountain wall. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
fly to the heights where Souli, birth-place of Botzarês,
is left to the foes against whom it so long and so
stoutly strove. They fly to Jôannina, so long the home of
light and comparative freedom amid surrounding darkness
and bondage, but which now, instead of receiving
the twice-promised deliverance, is again thrust back into
bondage for a while. We pass on by the High Thunderpeaks,
fencing in the land of Chimara, famous in the
wars of Ali. We double the promontory of Glôssa,
and find ourselves in the deep bay of Aulôn, Aulona,
Valona, with the town itself high on its hill, guarding
the entrance to the gulf from the other side. Here is
a true hill-city, unlike Korkyra, unlike even Buthrotum;
but while Korkyra and Buthrotum, each on its
shore, has each its history, Aulôn on its height has
none. We pass by the mouths of the great Illyrian
rivers, by Aoos and Apsos, and we leave between them
the place where once stood Apollonia, another of the
paths by which Rome made her way into the Eastern
world. At last we find ourselves in another bay, wider,
but not so deep as the bay of Aulôn. Here we look out
on what remains of a city whose earlier name dwells in
the memory of every reader of the greatest of Greek
historians, a city whose later name, famous through a
long series of revolutions, ought to be ever fresh in the
minds of Englishmen, as having become by a strange
destiny the scene of one stage of the same struggle as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Senlac and York and Ely. The city on which we
look was, under its elder name of Epidamnos, that
famous colony of Korkyra which gave an occasion
for the Peloponnesian war. Under its later name of
Dyrrhachion or Durazzo it beheld Englishmen and
Normans meet in arms, when Englishmen driven from
their homes had found a shelter and an honourable
calling in the service of the Eastern Cæsar.</p>

<p>The city on which we gaze, though it is only by a
figure that we can be said to gaze on the original
Epidamnos, is one of those cities which, without
ever holding any great place themselves, without
being widely ruling cities, without exercising any
direct influence on the course of the world's history,
have given occasion for the greatest events through
their relations to cities and powers greater than themselves.
Under none of its names was Epidamnos the
peer of Corinth in the elder state of things, or of
Venice in the later. Yet events of no small moment
came of the relations between Epidamnos and Corinth,
of the relations between Durazzo and Venice. Greater
events still came of the relations between Dyrrhachion
and Rome. The three names, though of course the
third is a simple corruption of the second, are convenient
to mark three periods in the history of the
place, just as one of the great Sicilian cities is conveniently
spoken of at three stages of its life as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Akragas, Agrigentum, and Girgenti. When and how
the name changed from Epidamnos to Dyrrhachion
is not clear, nor are the reasons given for the
change satisfactory. In practice, Epidamnos is its
old Greek name, Dyrrhachion its Roman, Durazzo its
mediæval name. But the name Dyrrhachion can be
Roman only in usage; the word itself is palpably
Greek. In strictness it seems that Epidamnos was the
name of the city, and Dyrrhachion the name of the
peninsula on which the city was built. The change
then has some analogy with the process by which the
tribal names in northern Gaul have displaced the
elder names of their chief cities, or with the change
among ourselves by which Kingston-on-Hull, as it is
still always called in formal writings, is in common
speech always spoken of as "Hull." Anyhow, under
Roman rule, the name of Dyrrhachion altogether displaced
Epidamnos. The new name gradually came to
be mispelled or Latinized into <i>Durachium</i> and <i>Duracium</i>,
and, in that state, it supplied the material for
more than one play upon words. When Robert Wiscard
came against it, he said that the city might indeed be
<i>Duracium</i>, but that he was a <i>dour</i> man (<i>durus</i>) and
knew how to <i>endure</i> (<i>durare</i>). The Norman made his
way by this path into the Eastern lands, as the Roman
had done before him; but as his course was quicker,
his stay was shorter. Epidamnos, along with Apollônia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
and Korkyra, were the first possessions of Rome east
of the Hadriatic. They were possessions of the ruling
city where dominion was for a long time disguised
under the name of alliance. But, under whatever
name, Rome, Old and New, held them till the Norman
came. But the Norman did not hold them till the
Venetian came. In a few years after the coming
of Robert Wiscard, Durazzo and Corfu were again
cities of the Eastern Empire.</p>

<p>Amidst all the revolutions which this little peninsula
has gone through, one law seems to hold.
Under all its names, it has had in a marked way
what we may call a colonial life, in the modern
sense of the word <i>colonial</i>. It has ever been an outpost
of some other power, of whatever power has
been strongest in those seas, and it has been an
outpost ever threatened by the elder races of the
mainland. Herein comes one of the differences
between this Albanian coast and the Dalmatian coast
further north. The Roman Peace took in all; but in
the days before and after the Roman Peace, the settlements
of Corinth, Venice, or any other colonizing
and civilizing power, along the coast of which Durazzo
was the centre, were merely scattered outposts. There
never was that continuous fringe of a higher culture,
Italian or Greek, which spread along the whole coast
further north. As a colony, an isolated colony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
Epidamnos or Durazzo was always exposed to the
attacks of barbarian neighbours. And in this land
the barbarian neighbours have always been the same.
The old Illyrian, the Albanian, the Arnaout, the
Skipetar&mdash;call him by whichever name we will&mdash;has
here lived on through all changes. He has indeed
a right to look on Greek, Roman, Norman, Angevin,
Servian, Venetian, and Ottoman, as alike intruders
within his own immemorial land. It was danger from
the Illyrian that led to the disputes which open the
history of Thucydides, when Corinth and Korkyra
fought over their common colony. It was danger from
the Illyrian which drove Epidamnos into the arms of
Rome. It was the Illyrian under his new name
who in the fourteenth century for a moment made
Durazzo the head of a national state, the capital of a
short-lived kingdom of Albania. Twice conquered
by the Normans of Apulia and Sicily, twice by their
Angevin successors, granted as part of a vassal kingdom
by the Norman and as a vassal duchy by the
Angevin, twice won by the Venetian commonwealth,
held by the despots of Epeiros, by the restored
Emperors of Constantinople, by the kings of Servia,
by the native kings of Albania, no city has had a
more varied succession of foreign masters; but, save
in the days of the old Epidamnian commonwealth and
in the days of the momentary Albanian kingdom, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
has always had a foreign master of some kind. But
in the endless succession of strangers which this
memorable spot has seen, as masters, as invaders, as
defenders, it is the Englishman and the Venetian who
can look with most satisfaction on their share in its
long history. Englishmen had the honour of guarding
the spot for the Eastern Cæsar; Venice had the
honour of being the last Christian champion to guard
it against the Ottoman Sultan.</p>

<p class="p2">We stand then gazing from our ship on what is left
of the city which Robert Wiscard crossed the sea to
conquer, which Alexios came with his motley host to
defend, and to find that in all that host the men whom
he could best trust were the English exiles. There, as
in their own island, the English axe and the Norman
lance clashed together; there the stout axemen alone
stayed to die, while the other soldiers of the Eastern
Rome, the Greek, the Turk, and the Slave, all turned
to fly around their Emperor. We look out, and we long
to know the site of the church of Saint Michael, which
our countrymen so stoutly guarded, till the Normans,
Norman-like, took to their favourite weapon of fire.
But may we confess to the weakness of looking at all
these things only from the deck of the steamer?
Perhaps there are some who may be forgiven if
they shrink from thrusting themselves alone, with no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
native or experienced guide, into the jaws of the
present masters of Durazzo. They may be the more
forgiven when those who have the care of their vessel
and its temporary inhabitants utter warnings against
any but the most stout-hearted trusting themselves
to the boats which form the only means of reaching
the Dyrrhachian peninsula. Strengthened in weakness
by such counsels, there seems a kind of magnanimity
in the resolution to abide in the ship, to say
that we have landed at free Corfu, that we shall land at
recovered Antivari, but that we will not betweenwhiles
set foot on any soil where the Turk still reigns. And
the time of distant gazing is not wasted. Without
risking ourselves either on Turkish ground or on the
rough waves of the Epidamnian bay, a fair general
view of the city may be had from the steamer. The
wide curve of the bay has for the most part a flat shore,
with a background of mountains in the distant landscape.
Towards the north-west corner, a promontory
of a good height, backed by a comb-like range of
peaks, rises at once from the water. This is the
peninsula of Dyrrhachion, once crowned by the Epidamnian
city. The modern town is seen on a small
part of the tower slope of the hill. The walls can be
traced through the greater part of their circuit; a
huge round bastion by the sea, more than one tower,
round and square, teach us that Durazzo has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
strongly fortified. If we may eke out our own distant
impressions by the help of an old print showing what
Durazzo was in times past, we see that it was fortified
indeed. We can recognize in the picture most of the
towers which we have seen with our own eyes, and
there is shown also another tower far greater, a huge
square tower of many stages, which no imagination of
the artist can have devised out of anything which
now comes into the sea-view of the city. But that
view enables us to trace out a few buildings within
the wall. We mark the distinctive symbols of the
two stranger forms of worship, from the East and from
the West, which have, each in its turn, supplanted or
dominated the native Church. The Latin church,
with its conspicuous bell-tower, carries on the traditions
of Angevin and Venetian rule; the mosque, with
its more conspicuous minaret, speaks of the more
abiding dominion of the representative of the False
Prophet. The native church meanwhile lurks significantly
unseen in the general view. Our teacher on
board our ship assures us that Durazzo is not without
an Orthodox place of worship; but he cannot point
out its whereabouts.</p>

<p>And it may be that it is no common anniversary
on which we look out on the land which has passed
into bondage. Looked at by the evening light of the
twenty-ninth day of May, the group of buildings at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Durazzo, alike by what is present to the eye and by
what is absent, brings to the mind the fate of a greater
city than Durazzo was in its proudest day. It makes
us muse how, after four hundred and eight and twenty
years, we have still to repeat the Psalmist's words: "O
God, the heathen have come into thine inheritance;
thy holy temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem
an heap of stones." Durazzo has not indeed,
like some other cities under the yoke, sunk to a heap
of stones; but it is easy to see how the Turkish town
has shrunk up within the Venetian walls, and again
how narrow must be the circuit of Venetian Durazzo
compared with the Epidamnos of the days of Thucydides,
or even with the Dyrrhachion beneath whose
walls our banished kinsmen so well maintained the
cause of the Eastern Augustus. For the church that
they so stoutly defended we need not say that it is vain
to look in such a Pisgah view of the city as is all that
we can take. But to the left of the present wall, where
the hill soars, one stage upon another, far above the
height of Durazzo that now is, we must surely place
the site of the akropolis of the old Korkyraian settlers.
Such a post, looking over the wide bay and commanding
its mouth, would be just what would commend
itself to the Greek colonists for the site of their
new stronghold, while the lower city would naturally
be spread over the more sheltered ground which holds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
all that is left of Durazzo under the rule of the Turk.
Pausanias indeed implies that there had been a
change of site before his time, that the Dyrrhachion
of his day did not stand on exactly the same ground
as the elder Epidamnos. No doubt the loftier site
was the older; men came down from the hill-top as
they did at Athens and Corinth. Thus much the
passing stranger can see of this historic spot, even
without setting his foot on the soil which the barbarian
has torn away from Christendom. His course
will bear him on to the place of his next halt, to the
spot which, only a few months back, was the last soil
which Christendom had won back from the barbarian.
Since then, if another land has been denied the promised
freedom, in a third the boon has been actually
bestowed. And we may comfort ourselves by thinking
that, while the shame of what is left undone belongs to
others, the praise of what is done belongs to our own
land only. We may comfort ourselves too by further
thinking that right and freedom are powers which have
an awkward way, when they have taken the inch, of
going on to take the ell. The wise men whose wisdom
consists in living politically from hand to mouth, are
again crying out against "re-opening the Eastern
question." In sailing along the shores, in scanning
their history in past and present times, we feel how
deep a truth was casually uttered in the shallow sneer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
which called that question "eternal." We feel how
vain is the dream of those who think that this or that
half-measure has solved it. As we gaze on enslaved
Durazzo, with free Greece behind us, with free Montenegro
before us&mdash;as we run swiftly in our thoughts
over the long history of the spot&mdash;as we specially
call up the deeds of our own countrymen on the
shore on which we look&mdash;we feel that something
indeed has been done, but that there is yet much
more to do. Before us, behind us, are lands to which
England, and England only, has given freedom. A
day must come when, what England has done for
Corfu, for Arta, and for Dulcigno, she must do for
Jôannina and for Durazzo.</p>

<h3>ANTIVARI.</h3>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span></p>
<h4>1881.</h4>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We wind up our course with one more of the once
subject cities of Venice, one where we can hardly say
that we are any longer following in Norman footsteps,
but whose history stands apart from the history of
Dalmatia and Istria, while it has much in common
with our last halting place. But here the main
interest belongs to our own day. It is with new and
strange feelings that we look out on a land which,
when we last passed by it, was still clutched tight in
the grasp of the barbarian, but to which we can now
give the new and thrilling name of the sea-coast of
Tzernagora. And yet it is with mingled feelings that
we gaze. We rejoice in the victories, in the extension,
of the unconquered principality, the land which has
shown itself a surer "bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite"
than Hungary or Poland, or even Venice, ever proved.
We rejoice that the warriors of the mountain, long
shut in by force and fraud, have again, with their own
right hands, cut their way to their own sea. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
yet we feel that, though the sea to which they have
cut their way is truly their own sea, their own ancient
heritage, yet the coast and the havens which they
have won are not the coast and the havens which they
should have won. If all had their own, Dulcigno,
Antivari, and the ewe lamb which the rich man stole
at Spizza, would be the havens of the free Albanian,
while the free Slave would have his outlet to the
Hadriatic waters at his own Cattaro and at Ragusa
too. In such an ideal state of things, the present lord
of Cattaro and Ragusa might reign peaceably and
harmlessly in the duchy of his grandmothers, happy
in deliverance from the curses of those whom he now
keeps back from union with the brethren whom they
love and with the one prince whom they acknowledge.
The Montenegrin, in short, kept back by wrong from
winning his way to the sea by peaceful union with
those who yearn for his presence, has been driven to
win his way to the sea by the conquest of lands which
were once the heritage of his race, but from which his
race has now passed away. Forbidden to be the
deliverer of the Slave, he has been forced to be the
conqueror of the Albanian. The Albanian Mussulman
himself has practically gained by being conquered;
still, as we said, if every one had his own, arrangements
would be different. The blame indeed lies, not
with the people who extend their borders when to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
extend their border is a matter of national life, but
with those who, not in the interest of any people,
nation, or language, but in the private interest of
their own family estate, sit by to hinder them from
extending their borders in the right way. We rejoice
then as we look for the first time on the sea-coast
of Montenegro; but we mourn that the sea-coast of
Montenegro lies where it does and not elsewhere.
We mourn too that the enlargement of Christendom,
the falling back of Islam, has been bought only by
the destruction of an ancient and beautiful city from
which the memorials at least of Christendom had not
wholly passed away.</p>

<p>Antibaris, Antivari, in the tongues of the land,
<i>Bar</i> and <i>Tivari</i>, is perhaps rather to be understood as
meaning "the Bari on the other side" than "the city
opposite Bari." But there is no doubt that its name
contains, in one way or another, a reference to the
more famous Bari, "Barium piscosum," on the other
side of the Hadriatic. And Antivari is the opposite
to Bari in a sense which was certainly not meant; no
two sites can well be more unlike one another than
the sites of Bari and of Antivari. The Apulian Bari
lies low on a flat shore, with not so much as a background
of hills; the Albanian Bari crowns a height,
with a wall of more soaring heights on each side of it.
The Apulian Bari had no chance of occupying such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
position as this; the marked difference between the
two coasts of the Hadriatic forbade it. But the
site of Antivari is hardly less unlike most of the
other sites on its own coast. Zara, Salona and its
successor Spalato, Epidauros and its successor Ragusa,
Cattaro, Durazzo, and a crowd of others of lesser name,
are none of them placed on heights. Some of them
nestle immediately at the foot of the mountain; some
have thrown out their defences, older or newer, some
way up the side of the mountain; in none is the city
itself perched high on the hills. For a parallel to
Antivari on this coast we have to go back to the
mountain citadel of Aulona. The position and the
name of Antivari seem to point to a state of things
differing both from the days of the Greek and Roman
foundations, and from the days of the cities which arose
to shelter their fugitives in the day of overthrow.
Long Salona stood low on the shore; the house of
Jovius stood low on the shore also; it did not come
into the head of the founders of either to plant city or
palace on the height of Clissa. When Antivari arose,
it would seem that men had gone back to that earlier
state of things which planted the oldest Argos, even
the oldest Corinth, on mountain peaks some way from
their own coasts. The inaccessible height had again
come to be looked on as a source of strength. Antivari
may take its place alongside of the mediæval Syra,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
the Latin town covering its own peaked hill&mdash;a <i>mons
acutus</i>, a Montacute, by the shore&mdash;while the oldest
and the newest Hermoupolis lies on the shore at its
feet. The town does not even look down at once on
the haven; it has to be reached in a manner sideways
from the haven. It is true indeed that the sea has
gone back, that the plain at the foot of the mountains
between the town and the shore was smaller than it
now is, even in times not far removed from our own.
But Antivari was never as Cattaro; it always stood
on a height, with some greater or less extent of
level ground between the town and its own haven.</p>

<p>The city thus placed has gone through its full
share of the revolutions of the eastern coasts of the
Hadriatic. Once a commonwealth under the protection
of the Servian kings and tzars, it came late under
Venetian rule. But it remained under that rule down
to a later time than any other of the possessions of the
Republic on this coast, save those which came within
the actual Dalmatian border and those detached points
further to the south which have a history of their own
in common with the so-called Ionian Islands. It was
for a while in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
what Budua was for so long afterwards, the furthest
point of the continuous rule of Saint Mark, a city
which remained part of Christendom after Durazzo
and Skodra had passed into the hands of the infidel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
In earlier times, when Antivari had a separate being,
its tendency was rather to a connexion with Ragusa
than with Venice. Ragusa, though the nearer of the
rivals, was the weaker, the less likely to change
alliance or protection into dominion. Antivari too,
like most other city-commonwealths, had its patricians
and plebeians, its disputes between the privileged and
the non-privileged order. As the justice of either side
at home was distrusted, it was agreed that the decision
of some classes of causes should be referred to the
courts of Ragusa. Such a settlement, though taking
another and more dangerous form, is the same in
principle as the favourite Italian custom of choosing
a foreign <i>podestà</i>, as the earlier usage by which cities
which had won their independence in all other points
were still willing to receive a criminal judge of the
Emperor's naming. In all these cases alike, the
stranger is looked on as more likely than the native
to deal out even-handed justice amid the disputes
and rivalries of persons and parties.</p>

<p>Though Antivari stands on a hill, it does not
crown any such height as those of Cortona or
Akrokorinthos, nor does it call for any such journey
as that which leads to the spot which masters of
the high-polite style will now doubtless call its
"metropolis" at Tzetinje. It stands on an advanced
point among the mountains, one easily commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
from higher points, as was soon found in the siege
of 1877. A road of no astonishing steepness leads
us up to the town&mdash;or more strictly to its ruins.
We look down on a church in the valley, whose
air proclaims it as belonging to the Orthodox communion;
and that church seems to be the only
untouched building within sight. It is not till we
get within the walls that we take in the full measure
of the destruction which has been wrought; but the
first glance shows that Antivari has suffered not
a little from the warfare of our own times. The walls
and towers are there; but we see that they fence in
only roofless buildings; the mosques, with their
minarets, several of them shattered, remind us that
we are drawing near to a city which has been won
for Christendom from Islam, as a nearer view reminds
us that it is a city which had before been won for
Islam from Christendom. We halt at a small <i>café</i>
outside the walls, where we receive a friendly greeting
from the representatives of Montenegrin authority
in the new conquest. Here too is the club and
reading-room of Antivari, supplied with newspapers
in the Slavonic, Italian, and Turkish tongues; the
really prevailing speech of the district, the immemorial
Skipetar or Albanian, hardly boasts of a
representative in the press. Here too are gathered
a few fragments from the ruins, a few capitals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
sculptures, and inscriptions, all or most of Venetian
times. Among them is the winged lion himself, and
the epitaph of a local dignitary who bears the very
English-sounding title of "justitia pacis." Even
among ourselves embodied righteousness sometimes
takes the same abstract form, instead of the more
mortal and fleshly "justitiarius." A slight descent
and a steep ascent leads us through a rebuilt suburb,
which now forms the only part of Antivari which
serves as a dwelling-place of man. A line of shops,
or rather booths, supplies the needs of the neighbouring
people, among whom Christians and Mussulmans,
Slaves and Albanians, seem pretty equally
mingled. A Montenegrin sentinel, whose national
coat must once have been whiter than it now is,
guards the gate, a Venetian gate where inscriptions
in the Arabic character record the dominion of the
late masters of Antivari. We enter, we gaze around,
we climb a tower for a better view, and we look on
a scene of havoc which is startling to men of peaceful
lives, and which, one would think, must be unusual
even in the experience of men of the sword. We
believe that we are speaking the truth when we say
that every building within the enclosed space has
become uninhabitable; certainly not one seemed to
be inhabited. This destruction is indeed not wholly
the immediate result of the siege. A powder-magazine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
was afterwards struck by lightning, and its
explosion destroyed whatever the siege had spared.
But the havoc wrought by the siege itself must
have been fearful. Antivari is as strictly a collection
of ruins, and of nothing but ruins, as Ninfa at the foot
of the Volscian hills, looking up at the mighty walls
of Norba. But Ninfa was simply forsaken some ages
back. Its inhabitants fled from an unhealthy site,
and left their houses, churches, and military defences,
to crumble away. But at Antivari we see the work
of destruction in our own day, almost at the present
moment. Four years back, the traveller passing
along the Albanian coast was shown where Antivari,
then an inhabited town, nestled among its rocks.
The war was then raging inland; the Montenegrin
was then defending his own heights against Turkish
invasion; he had not yet come down to win back a
fragment of his ancient coast from one of the two
intruders who kept him from it. The traveller comes
again; this time he does not only look from afar, but
examines on the spot with his own eyes. But he finds
only the shattered fragments of what four years before
was a city of men.</p>

<p>And, small as Antivari must have been even in its
most flourishing times, it is no mean city that it must
have been. It must be remembered that Antivari,
though it was a Mussulman town under Turkish rule,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
was never in any strict sense a Turkish town. Its
history is that of Albania generally, as it is the
history of large classes of men in Bosnia. Antivari
was easily won by the Turk, and it remained in
the hands of its old inhabitants, Christian Albanians
and Venetian settlers. Gradually, for the sake of
their temporal interests, they conformed outwardly to
the religion of their conquerors, and so passed from
the subject to the ruling order. At first, this was a
mere outward conformity for worldly ends; men still
hoped that some chance of warfare would bring back
the rule of Saint Mark. If so, they were ready to
return to the faith which they still secretly held.
But the happy revolution never came; new generations
sprang up with whom Islam was an hereditary
creed, and Antivari became a Mussulman city. But
it never became a Turkish city. The descendants of
the once Christian inhabitants lived on in their
fathers' houses, and worshipped in the same temples
as their fathers, though they were now turned to the
use of another faith. Each church had a minaret
added, and it became a mosque. In most cases of
Mahometan conquest, the conquerors took the head
church of the city as a trophy of their own faith, but
left the subject Christians in possession of one or
more of the lesser churches. So, in this same region,
it was at Durazzo; so it was at Trebinje; in both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
there was a church, or more than one, within the
walls. Here at Antivari, as the inhabitants gradually
embraced Islam, all the churches became mosques;
and thus, for the very reason that there was less of
violent disturbance than in most cases of Turkish
conquest, Antivari, while never becoming Turkish,
became more strictly Mussulman than most cities
under Turkish rule. The churches, or rather their
ruins, still stand, examples of the usual churches of
the country, none of them remarkable for size or
antiquity or architectural splendour; but still essentially
churches, with their fabrics untouched, save
only the inevitable addition of the minaret. Some
of them even keep memorials of their earlier use of
which one would have expected Mussulman zeal to wipe
out every trace as monuments of idolatry. Intruding
Turks or Saracens would doubtless have done so; but
the Mahometan descendants of the Christian citizens
of Antivari still felt a tenderness for the works of
their forefathers. Even pictures of Christian subjects
have been spared. In one case especially, in
a church which does not seem ever to have been a
mosque, but, as having perhaps been a private chapel,
to have formed part of a private house, among other
kindred pictures, the baptism of our Lord in Jordan
is still almost as clear as when the painter first traced
it on the wall. Old ancestral memories, perhaps the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
vague feeling that after all a day of change might
come&mdash;the feeling which led Bosnian beys, while
holding their Christian countrymen in bondage, to
keep Christian patents of nobility and even concealed
objects of Christian worship&mdash;were clearly stronger
in Antivari than any strict regard to the Mussulman
law.</p>

<p>And as it was with the churches, so it was with
the houses. Antivari never became, like Trebinje, a
tumble-down Eastern town, nor, like Butrinto, a collection
of beggarly huts, not fit to be called a town
at all. It was a small, but well-built city, after the
pattern of the other cities on the eastern coast of
the Hadriatic. There was clearly no moment of
general havoc; the Mussulman lived on in the house
of his Christian father. Some of those houses must
have been still almost new when their owners embraced
the faith of their conquerors. At every step
we see among the shattered houses some pretty scrap,
door or window, of the style which we commonly call
Venetian; we see some too which belong to the confirmed
<i>Renaissance</i>, and which can hardly be older than
the sixteenth century. One stately building indeed
seems to have perished. An old print of Antivari, in
a book called <i>Viaggio da Venetia a Costantinopoli</i>, a
book without date but which has an air of the
sixteenth century, shows what is plainly meant for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
municipal palace, after the same general type as the
bigger one at Venice and the more beautiful one at
Ragusa. It has arcades below and windows above.
Still as we tread, even in their state of ruin, the
streets, the little <i>piazze</i>, of what once was Antivari,
we see that the city perched on its Albanian height
must have been no unworthy fellow of its neighbours
on the Dalmatian shore.</p>

<p>It is sad that the enlargement of Europe and of
Christendom, the winning back of their ancient coast
by the valiant warriors of the Black Mountain, should
have been bought only at such a price as the destruction
of this interesting and really beautiful little city.
The loss, it may be feared, cannot be repaired. A
gently working hand might possibly set up again the
ruined houses and churches nearly as they once were.
Or it might at first sight seem a more obvious work
to forsake the ruined hill-town, and to build another
by the haven, a new Montenegrin Cattaro, to make
up as far as may be for the city by the <i>Bocche</i> so
cruelly torn away from its free brethren. But either
scheme seems to be forbidden by the growing unhealthiness
of the spot. The place has been for some
while getting more and more fever-stricken, and the
disease has now&mdash;seemingly since the siege&mdash;spread
upwards to the hill-town itself. It is for medical
knowledge to judge whether, as is said to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
case in some parts of the Roman <i>Campagna</i>, sudden
colonization, the settlement of a large number of new
inhabitants at once, could do anything to check the
evil. Failing this chance, it would seem as if Antivari
was doomed utterly to perish. A new Montenegrin
town and haven may arise, but not on the site of
the ancient town and haven of the eastern Bari.</p>

<p>On whom rests the blame? Surely not on the conquerors,
whose warfare was waged in the noblest cause
for which man can fight, for their faith, their freedom,
their national life, the extension of freedom and
national life to their brethren under the yoke. Nor
can we say that it rests with the men who fought
against them, who, from their own side, were fighting
for faith and freedom and national life fully as much.
It rather rests with the dangerous neighbour of both,
whose very existence is founded on the trampling
down of freedom and national life among all its
neighbours. It rests with the power which takes care
to strike no blows itself, but which knows how to suck
no small advantage from the blows which are struck
by others on either side. The ruin of Antivari is
in truth the work, though the indirect work, of the
power hard by, the power which was not ashamed to
stretch forth its hand for such a spoil as Spizza, the
hard-won earnings of its poor neighbour. The guilt
of ruined Antivari rests with those who drove its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
conquerors to conquest in the wrong place by hindering
them from peaceful advance in the right place.
It rests with those who stirred up its defenders to
a hopeless resistance by promises which never were
fulfilled. When we see how in 1878 Montenegro
was allowed to keep possession of ruined and almost
worthless Antivari, but was forced to give up its
other comparatively flourishing conquests of Spizza
and Dulcigno, we better understand how the rule of
doing as one would be done by is looked on in
the council-chamber of an Apostolic King. And we
see too, with some comfort, how England, as one of
her first national acts when England found herself
once more under English leadership, knew how to
step in, with vigour and with patience, to undo at
least one part of the wrong which had been done.</p>
